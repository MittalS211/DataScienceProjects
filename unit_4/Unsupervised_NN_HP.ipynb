       "the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from hisnephew Harry's room.\"Third time this week!\" he roared across the table. \"If you can'tcontrol that owl, it'll have to go!\"Harry tried, yet again, to explain.\"She's bored,\" he said. \"She's used to flying around outside. If I couldjust let her out at night -\"\"Do I look stupid?\" snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg danglingfrom his bushy mustache. \"I know what'll happen if that owl's letout.\"He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long,loud belch from the Dursleys' son, Dudley.2\"I want more bacon.\"\"There's more in the frying pan, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia,turning misty eyes on her massive son. \"We must build you up whilewe've got the chance .... I don't like the sound of that school food......\"Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,\"said Uncle Vernon heartily. \"Dudley gets enough, don't you, son?\"Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of thekitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry.\"Pass the frying pan.\"\"You've forgotten the magic word,\" said Harry irritably.The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family wasincredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash thatshook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream andclapped her hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet,veins throbbing in his temples.\"I meant `please'!\" said Harry quickly. \"I didn't mean -\"\"WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,\" thundered his uncle, spraying spitover the table, \"ABOUT SAYING THE `M' WORD IN OURHOUSE?\"\"But I -\"\"HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!\" roared UncleVernon, pounding the table with his fist.\"I just -\"\"I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OFYOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!\"Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who wastrying to heave Dudley to his feet.3\"All right,\" said Harry, \"all right. . . \"Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros andwatching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, UncleVernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at anymoment, because Harry Potter wasn't a normal boy. As a matter offact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be.Harry Potter was a wizard - a wizard fresh from his first year atHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleyswere unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to howHarry felt.He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constantstomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways andghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), themail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in hisfour-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper,Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and,especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world(six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players onbroomsticks).All Harry's spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-lineNimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboardunder the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home.What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the HouseQuidditch team because he hadn't practiced all summer? What was itto the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of hishomework done? The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles(not a drop of magical blood in their veins),and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family wasa matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlockedHarry's owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carryingmessages to anyone in the wizarding world.Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon waslarge and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia4was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry,on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes andjet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and onhis forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for awizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry's very mysterious past, ofthe reason he had been left on the Dursleys' doorstep eleven yearsbefore.At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse fromthe greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose namemost witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry's parents haddied in Voldemort's attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightningscar, and somehow - nobody understood why Voldemort's powers hadbeen destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother's sister and herhusband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, neverunderstanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaningto, believing the Dursleys' story that he had got his scar in the carcrash that had killed his parents.And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry,and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place atwizard school, where he and his scar were famous ... but now theschool year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for thesummer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in somethingsmelly.The Dursleys hadn't even remembered that today happened to beHarry's twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn't been high; they'dnever given him a real present, let alone a cake - but to ignore itcompletely ...At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said,\"Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.\"Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.\"This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career, \"5said Uncle Vernon.Harry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He'd been talking of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wifewere coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a hugeorder from him (Uncle Vernon's company made drills).\"I think we should run through the schedule one more time,\" saidUncle Vernon. \"We should all be in position at eight o'clock. Petunia,you will be -?\"\"In the lounge,\" said Aunt Petunia promptly, \"waiting to welcome themgraciously to our home.\"\"Good, good. And Dudley?\"\"I'll be waiting to open the door.\" Dudley put on a foul, simperingsmile. \"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\"\"They'll love him!\" cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.\"Excellent, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon. Then he rounded on Harry.\"And you?\"\"I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I'm notthere,\" said Harry tonelessly.\"Exactly,\" said Uncle Vernon nastily. \"I will lead them into thelounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour them -drinks. At eightfifteen-\"\"I'll announce dinner,\" said Aunt Petunia.\"And, Dudley, you'll say -\"\"May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?\" saidDudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.\"My perfect little gentleman!\" sniffed Aunt Petunia.\"And you?\" said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.6\"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\"said Harry dully.\"Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments atdinner. Petunia, any ideas?\"\"Vernon tells me you're a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason.... Do tell mewhere you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason ......\"Perfect. . . Dudley?\"\"How about -'We had to write an essay about our hero at school,Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.\"'This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petuniaburst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under thetable so they wouldn't see him laughing.\"And you, boy?\"Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.\"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\"he said.\"Too right, you will,\" said Uncle Vernon forcefully. \"The Masons don't know anything about you and it's going to stay that way.When dinner's over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge forcoffee, Petunia, and I'll bring the subject around to drills. With anyluck, I'll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten.be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time tomorrow.Harry couldn't feel too excited about this. He didn't think theDursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did onPrivet Drive.\"Right - I'm off into town to pick up the dinner jackets forDudley and me. And you,\" he snarled at Harry. \"You stay out ofyour aunt's way while she's cleaning.\"Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day.He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sangunder his breath:7\"Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me. . .No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the eveningpretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He hadnever felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, moreeven than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, RonWeasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn't seem to bemissing him at all. Neither of them had written to him all summer,even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come andstay.Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlockingHedwig's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermionewith a letter, but it wasn't worth the risk. Underage wizards weren'tallowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadn't told theDursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn themall into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in thecupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the firstcouple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense wordsunder his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fastas his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence from Ron andHermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world thateven taunting Dudley had lost its appeal - and now Ron and Hermionehad forgotten his birthday.What wouldn't he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From anywitch or wizard? He'd almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy,Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn't all been a dream ....Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end oflast term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than LordVoldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, buthe was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power.Harry had slipped through Voldemort's clutches for a second time, butit had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry keptwaking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering whereVoldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyesHarry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had beenstaring absent-mindedly into the hedge - and the hedge was staring back.Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves.Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the8lawn.\"I know what day it is,\" sang Dudley, waddling toward him.The huge eyes blinked and vanished.\"What?\" said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they hadbeen.\"I know what day it is,\" Dudley repeated, coming right up to him.\"Well done,\" said Harry. \"So you've finally learned the days of theweek.\"\"Today's your birthday,\" sneered Dudley. \"How come you haven't gotany cards? Haven't you even got friends at that freak place?\"\"Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,\" saidHarry coolly.Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fatbottom.\"Why're you staring at the hedge?\" he said suspiciously.\" I , m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it onfire,\" said Harry.Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face.\"You c-can't - Dad told you you're not to do m-magic - he said he'llchuck you out of the house - and you haven't got anywhere else to go -you haven't got any friends to take you -\"\"Jiggery pokery!\" said Harry in a fierce voice. \"Hocus pocus squigglywiggly -\"\"MUUUUUUM!\" howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashedback toward the house. \"MUUUUM! He's doing you know what!\"Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley northe hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really9done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at hishead with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, withthe promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished.While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harrycleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed theflowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the gardenbench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harryknew he shouldn't have risen to Dudley's bait, but Dudley had saidthe very thing Harry had been thinking himself... maybe he didn't haveany friends at Hogwarts ....Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as hespread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat runningdown his face.It was half past seven ,in the evening when at last, exhausted, heheard Aunt Petunia calling him.\"Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!\"Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top ofthe fridge stood tonight's pudding: a huge mound of whipped creamand sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.\"Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!\" snapped Aunt Petunia,pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchentable. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. Themoment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate.\"Upstairs! Hurry!\"As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught aglimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets. He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle Vernon's furious face appeared at the foot ofthe stairs.\"Remember, boy - one sound -\"Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside, closedthe door, and turned to collapse on his bed.The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.10C H-H A P T E RR T W oarry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing. The littlecreature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes thesize of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had beenwatching him out of the garden hedge that morning.As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley's voice from the hall.\"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\"The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of itslong, thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearingwhat looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes.\"Er - hello,\" said Harry nervously.\"Harry Potter!\" said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry wassure would carry down the stairs. \"So long has Dobby wanted to meetyou, sir ... Such an honor it is . . . .\"\"Th-thank you,\" said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into hisdesk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage. Hewanted to ask, \"What are you?\" but thought it would sound too rude,so instead he said, \"Who are you?\"\"Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,\" said the creature.\"Oh - really?\" said Harry. \"Er - I don't want to be rude or anything,but - this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in mybedroom.\"Aunt Petunias high, false laugh sounded from the living room. The elfhung his head.\"Not that I'm not pleased to meet you,\" said Harry quickly, \"but, er,is there any particular reason you're here?\"11\"Oh, yes, sir,\" said Dobby earnestly. \"Dobby has come to tell you,sir ... it is difficult, sir ... Dobby wonders where to begin . . . .\"\"Sit down,\" said Harry politely, pointing at the bed.To his horror, the elf burst into tears - very noisy tears.\"S-sit down!\" he wailed. \"Never ... never ever. . . \"Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter.\"I'm sorry,\" he whispered, \"I didn't mean to offend you or anything -\"\"Offend Dobby!\" choked the elf. \"Dobby has never been asked to sitdown by a wizard - like an equal-\"Harry, trying to say \"Shh!\" and look comforting at the same time,ushered Dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, lookinglike a large and very ugly doll. At last he managed to control himself,and sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of wateryadoration.\"You can't have met many decent wizards,\" said Harry, trying tocheer him up.Dobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he leapt up andstarted banging his head furiously on the window, shouting, \"BadDobby! Bad Dobby!\"\"Don't - what are you doing?\" Harry hissed, springing up and pullingDobby back onto the bed - Hedwig had woken up with aparticularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against thebars of her cage.\"Dobby had to punish himself, sir,\" said the elf, who had gone slightlycross-eyed. \"Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir . . . .\"\"Your family?\"\"The wizard family Dobby serves, sir... DOBBY'S is a houseelf -bound to serve one house and one family forever . .....12\"Do they know you're here?\" asked Harry curiously.Dobby shuddered.\"Oh, no, sir, no ... Dobby will have to punish himself most grievouslyfor coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in theoven door for this. If they ever knew, sir _\"\"But won't they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?\"\"Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself forsomething, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes theyreminds me to do extra punishments ......\"But why don't you leave? Escape?\"\"A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never setDobby free ... Dobby will serve the family until he dies, sir . . . .\"Harry stared.\"And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks,\"he said. \"This makes the Dursleys sound almost human. Can't anyonehelp you? Can't I?\"Almost at once, Harry wished he hadn't spoken. Dobby dissolved againinto wails of gratitude.\"Please,\" Harry whispered frantically, \"please be quiet. If the Dursleyshear anything, if they know you're here -\"\"Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby ... Dobby has heard of yourgreatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew . .....Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, \"Whateveryou've heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. I'm not even topof my year at Hogwarts; that's Hermione, she -\"But he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful.13\"I-Tarry Potter is humble and modest,\" said Dobby reverently, his orblikeeyes aglow. \"Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named -\"\"Voldemort?\" said Harry.Dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, \"Ah, speak notthe name, sir! Speak not the name!\"\"Sorry\" said Harry quickly. \"I know lots of people don't like it. Myfriend Ron -\"He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.'Dobby heard tell,\" he said hoarsely, \"that Harry Potter met the DarkLord for a second time just weeks ago ... that Harry Potter escapedYet again. \"Harry nodded and Dobby's eyes suddenly shone with tears.,Ah, sir,\" he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubbypillowcase he was wearing. \"Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He hasbraved so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protectHarry Potter, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears inthe oven door later... Harry Potter must notgo back to Hogwarts.\"There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forksfrom downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon's voice.\"W-what?\" Harry stammered. \"But I've got to go back - term startson September first. It's all that's keeping me going. You don't knowwhat it's like here. I don't belong here. I belong in your world - atHogwarts.\"\"No, no, no,\" squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his earsflapped. \"Harry Potter must stay where he is safe. He is too great,too good, to lose. If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will bein mortal danger.\"14\"Why?\" said Harry in surprise.\"There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible thingshappen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,\"whispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all over. \"Dobby has known itfor months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in peril. He is tooimportant, sir!\"\"What terrible things?\" said Harry at once. \"Who's plotting them?\"Dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his headfrantically against the wall.\"All right!\" cried Harry, grabbing the elf's arm to stop him. \"You can'ttell me. I understand. But why are you warning me?\" A sudden,unpleasant thought struck him. \"Hang on - this hasn't got anything todo with Vol- - sorry - with You-Know-Who, has it?You could just shake or nod,\" he added hastily as Dobby's headtilted worryingly close to the wall again.Slowly, Dobby shook his head.\"Not -not He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir ='But Dobby's eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to giveHarry a hint. Harry, however, was completely lost.\"He hasn't got a brother, has he?\"Dobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever.\"Well then, I can't think who else would have a chance of makinghorrible things happen at Hogwarts,\" said Harry. \"I mean, there'sDumbledore, for one thing - you know who Dumbledore is, don'tyou?\"Dobby bowed his head.\"Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has everhad. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore's powersrival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his15strength. But, sir\" - Dobby's voice dropped to an urgent whisper -\"there are powers Dumbledore doesn't ... powers no decent wizard.. .\"And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed,seized Harry's desk lamp, and started beating himself around thehead with earsplitting yelps.A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heartthudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling,\"Dudley must have left his television on again, the little tyke!\"\"Quick! In the closet!\" hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby in, shutting thedoor, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned.\"What - the - devil - are - you - doing?\" said Uncle Vernon throughgritted teeth, his face horribly close to Harry's. \"You've just ruined thepunch line of my Japanese golfer joke .... One more sound and you'llwish you'd never been born, boy!\"He stomped flat-footed from the room.Shaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet.\"See what it's like here?\" he said. \"See why I've got to go back toHogwarts? It's the only place I've got -well, I think I've got friends. \"\"Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?\" said Dobby slyly.\"I expect they've just been - wait a minute,\" said Harry, frowning.\"How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?\"Dobby shuffled his feet.\"Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Dobby did it for the best -\"\"Have you been stopping my letters?\"\"Dobby has them here, sir,\" said the elf. Stepping nimbly out of Harry'sreach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of thepillowcase he was wearing. Harry could make out Hermione's neat16writing, Ron's untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as thoughit was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid.Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry.\"Harry Potter mustn't be angry... Dobby hoped ... if Harry Potterthought his friends had forgotten him ... Harry Potter might not want togo back to school, sir . .....Harry wasn't listening. He made a grab for the letters, but Dobbyjumped out of reach.\"Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his wordthat he will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this is a danger you mustnot face! Say you won't go back, sir!\"\"No,\" said Harry angrily. \"Give me my friends' letters!\"\"Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice,\" said the elf sadly.Before Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the bedroom door,pulled it open, and sprinted down the stairs.Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, trying not tomake a sound. He jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on thehall carpet, looking around for Dobby. From the dining room heheard Uncle Vernon saying, \". . . tell Petunia that very funny storyabout those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. She's been dying tohear. . . \"Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear.Aunt Petunia's masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream andsugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling. On top of acupboard in the corner crouched Dobby.\"No,\" croaked Harry. \"Please ... they'll kill me ......\"Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school -\"\"Dobby ... please ...17\"Say it, sir -\"\"I can't -\"Dobby gave him a tragic look.\"Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good.\"The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash. Creamsplattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. With a cracklike a whip, Dobby vanished.There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernonburst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from headto foot in Aunt Petunias pudding.At first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss thewhole thing over. (\"Just our nephew - very disturbed meeting strangersupsets him, so we kept him upstairs) He shooed the shocked Masonsback into the dining room, promised Harry he would flay him to withinan inch of his life when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop.Aunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and Harry, stillshaking, started scrubbing the kitchen clean.Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal - if it hadn'tbeen for the owl.Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-dinner mints whena huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped aletter on Mrs. Mason's head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Masonscreamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting aboutlunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that hiswife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to askwhether this was their idea of a joke.Harry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as UncleVernon advanced on him, a demonic glint in his tiny eyes.\"Read it!\" he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had delivered.\"Go on - read it!\"18Harry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings.Dear Mr. Potter,We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at yourplace of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine.As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spellsoutside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead toexpulsion from said school (Decree for the Reasonable Restriction ofUnderage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C).We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity thatrisks notice by members of the non-magical community (Muggles) isa serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederationof Warlocks' Statute of Secrecy.Enjoy your holidays!

Slipped your mind, I daresay .....He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teethbared. \"Well, I've got news for you, boy . ... I'm locking you up ....You're never going back to that school ... never ... and if you try andmagic yourself out - they'll expel you!\"And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs.Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning,19he paid a man to fit bars on Harry's window. He himself fitted a catflapin the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could bepushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use thebathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his roomaround the clock.Three days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, andHarry couldn't see any way out of his situation. He lay on his bedwatching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wonderedmiserably what was going to happen to him.What was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwartswould expel him for doing it? Yet life at Privet Drive had reached anall-time low. Now that the Dursleys knew they weren't going to wakeup as fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby might have savedHarry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things weregoing, he'd probably starve to death anyway.The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunias hand appeared, pushing a bowlof canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching withhunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone-cold, buthe drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig'scage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl intoher empty food tray. She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look ofdeep disgust.\"It's no good turning your beak up at it - that's all we've got,\" saidHarry grimly.He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and layback down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had beenbefore the soup.Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks, what would happenif he didn't turn up at Hogwarts? Would someone be sent to see whyhe hadn't come back? Would they be able to make the Dursleys lethim go?The room was growing dark. Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mindspinning over the same unanswerable questions, Harry fell into anuneasy sleep.20He dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card readingUNDERAGE WIZARD attached to his cage. People goggled through the barsat him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. He sawDobby's face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but Dobbycalled, \"Harry Potter is safe there, sir!\" and vanished. Then theDursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage, laughing athim.\"Stop it,\" Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head.\"Leave me alone ... cut it out ... I'm trying to sleep . . . .\"He opened his eyes. Moonlight was shining through the bars on thewindow. And someone was goggling through the bars at him: a frecklefaced,red-haired, long-nosed someone.Ron Weasley was outside Harry's window.21Ron.l\" breathed Harry, creeping to the window and pushing it up sothey could talk through the bars. \"Ron, how did you - What the -?\"Harry's mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hithim. Ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car,which was parked in midair Grinning at Harry from the front seatswere Fred and George, Ron's elder twin brothers.\"All right, Harry?\" asked George.\"What's been going on?\" said Ron. \"Why haven't you been answeringmy letters? I've asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dadcame home and said you'd got an official warning for using magic infront of Muggles -\"\"It wasn't me - and how did he know?\"\"He works for the Ministry,\" said Ron. \"You know we're not supposedto do spells outside school -\"\"You should talk,\" said Harry, staring at the floating car.\"Oh, this doesn't count,\" said Ron. \"We're only borrowing this. It'sDad's, we didn't enchant it. But doing magic in front of those Mugglesyou live with -\"\"I told you, I didn't - but it'll take too long to explain now look, can youtell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won'tlet me come back, and obviously I can't magic myself out, because theMinistry'Il think that's the second spell I've done in three days, so -\"\"Stop gibbering,\" said Ron. \"We've come to take you home with us.\"\"But you can't magic me out either -\"22\"We don't need to,\" said Ron, jerking his head toward the front seatand grinning. \"You forget who I've got with me.\"\"Tie that around the bars,\" said Fred, throwing the end of a rope toHarry.\"If the Dursleys wake up, I'm dead,\" said Harry as he tied the ropetightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car.\"Don't worry,\" said Fred, \"and stand back.\"Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed tohave realized how important this was and kept still and silent. The carrevved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, thebars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up inthe air. Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a fewfeet above the ground. Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car.Harry listened anxiously, but there was no sound from the Dursleys'bedroom.When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversedas close as possible to Harry's window.\"Get in,\" Ron said.\"But all my Hogwarts stuff - my wand - my broomstick -\"\"Where is it?\"\"Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can't get out of thisroom -\"\"No problem,\" said George from the front passenger seat. \"Out ofthe way, Harry.\"Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harry'sroom. You had to hand it to them, thought Harry, as George took anordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock.\"A lot of wizards think it's a waste of time, knowing this sort ofMuggle trick,\" said Fred, \"but we feel they're skills worth learning,even if they are a bit slow.\"23There was a small click and the door swung open.\"So - we'll get your trunk - you grab anything you need from yourroom and hand it out to Ron,\" whispered George.\"Watch out for the bottom stair - it creaks,\" Harry whispered backas the twins disappeared onto the dark landing.Harry dashed around his room, collecting his things and passing themout of the window to Ron. Then he went to help Fred and Georgeheave his trunk up the stairs. Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough.At last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunkthrough Harry's room to the open window. Fred climbed back intothe car to pull with Ron, and Harry and George pushed from thebedroom side. Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window.Uncle Vernon coughed again.\"A bit more,\" panted Fred, who was pulling from inside the car.\"One good push -\"Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slidout of the window into the back seat of the car.\"Okay, let's go,\" George whispered.But as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loudscreech from behind him, followed immediately by the thunder ofUncle Vernon's voice.\"THAT RUDDY OWL!\"\"I've forgotten Hedwig!\"Harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on - hesnatched up Hedwig's cage, dashed to the window, and passed itout to Ron. He was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers whenUncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open.For a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway; then24he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry, grabbinghim by the ankle.Ron, Fred, and George seized Harry's arms and pulled as hard asthey could.\"Petunia!\" roared Uncle Vernon. \"He's getting away! HE'SGETTING AWAY!\"But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry's leg slid out ofUncle Vernon's grasp - Harry was in the car - he'd slammed thedoor shut\"Put your foot down, Fred!\" yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenlytoward the moon.Harry couldn't believe it - he was free. He rolled down thewindow, the night air whipping his hair, and looked back at theshrinking rooftops of Privet Drive. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, andDudley were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harry's window.\"See you next summer!\" Harry yelled.The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat,grinning from ear to ear.\"Let Hedwig out,\" he told Ron. \"She can fly behind us. She hasn't hada chance to stretch her wings for ages.\"George handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment later, Hedwig soaredjoyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost.\"So - what's the story, Harry?\" said Ron impatiently. \"What's beenhappening?\"Harry told them all about Dobby, the warning he'd given Harry andthe fiasco of the violet pudding. There was a long, shocked silencewhen he had finished.\"Very fishy,\" said Fred finally.25\"Definitely dodgy\" agreed George. \"So he wouldn't even tell you who'ssupposed to be plotting all this stuff?\"\"I don't think he could,\" said Harry. \"I told you, every time he got closeto letting something slip, he started banging his head against the wall.\"He saw Fred and George look at each other.\"What, you think he was lying to me?\" said Harry.\"Well,\" said Fred, \"put it this way - house-elves have got powerfulmagic of their own, but they can't usually use it without their master'spermission. I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you coming back to Hogwarts. Someone's idea of a joke. Can you think ofanyone at school with a grudge against you?\"\"Yes,\" said Harry and Ron together, instantly.\"Draco Malfoy,\" Harry explained. \"He hates me.\"\"Draco Malfoy?\" said George, turning around. \"Not Lucius Malfoy'sson?\"\"Must be, it's not a very common name, is it?\" said Harry.Y.\"I've heard Dad talking about him,\" said George. \"He was a bigsupporter of You-Know-Who.\"\"And when You-Know-Who disappeared,\" said Fred, craningaround to look at Harry, \"Lucius Malfoy came back saying he'd nevermeant any of it. Load of dung - Dad reckons he was right in You-Know-Who's inner circle.\"Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy's family before, and theydidn't surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley looklike a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy.\"I don't know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf saidHarry.26\"Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family, and they'llbe rich,\" said Fred.\"Yeah, Mum's always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,\"said George. \"But all we've got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic andgnomes all over the garden. House-elves come with big old manorsand castles and places like that; you wouldn't catch one in our house .. . .\"Harry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually hadthe best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; hecould just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sendingthe family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts alsosounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do. Had Harrybeen stupid to take Dobby seriously?\"I'm glad we came to get you, anyway,\" said Ron. \"I was gettingreally worried when you didn't answer any of my letters. I thought itwas Errol's fault at first-\"\"Who's Errol?\"\"Our owl. He's ancient. It wouldn't be the first time he'd collapsedon a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes -\"\"Who?\"\"The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made prefect,\"said Fred from the front.\"But Percy wouldn't lend him to me,\" said Ron. \"Said he neededhim.\"\"Percy's been acting very oddly this summer,\" said George,frowning. \"And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending aload of time shut up in his room .... I mean, there's only so manytimes you can polish a prefect badge .... You're driving too far west,Fred,\" he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. Fred27twiddled the steering wheel.\"So, does your dad know you've got the car?\" said Harry, guessingthe answer.\"Er, no,\" said Ron, \"he had to work tonight. Hopefully we'll be ableto get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it.\"\"What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, anyway?\"\"He works in the most boring department,\" said Ron. \"The Misuseof Muggle Artifacts Office.\"\"The what?\"\"It's all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-made, youknow, in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house. Like,last year, some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiquesshop. This Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried to serveher friends tea in it. It was a nightmare - Dad was working overtimefor weeks.\"\"What happened?\"\"The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the placeand one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clampedto his nose. Dad was going frantic - it's only him and an old warlockcalled Perkins in the office -and they had to do Memory Charms andall sorts of stuff to cover it up -\"\"But your dad - this car -\"Fred laughed. \"Yeah, Dad's crazy about everything to do withMuggles; our shed's full of Muggle stuff. He takes it apart, puts spellson it, and puts it back together again. If he raided our house he'dhave to put himself under arrest. It drives Mum mad.\"\"That's the main road,\" said George, peering down through thewindshield. \"We'll be there in ten minutes .... Just as well, it's gettinglight . . . .\"A faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east.28Fred brought the car lower, and Harry saw a dark patchwork offields and clumps of trees.\"We're a little way outside the village,\" said George. \"Ottery St.Catchpole.\"Lower and lower went the flying car. The edge of a brilliant red sunwas now gleaming through the trees.\"Touchdown!\" said Fred as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground.They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, andHarry looked out for the first time at Ron's house.It looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extrarooms had been added here and there until it was several stories highand so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic (which,Harry reminded himself, it probably was). Four or five chimneys wereperched on top of the red roof. A lopsided sign stuck in the groundnear the entrance read, THE BuRRow. Around the front door lay a jumbleof rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron. Several fat brown chickenswere pecking their way around the yard.\"It's not much,\" said Ron.\"It's wonderful,\" said Harry happily, thinking of Privet Drive.They got out of the car.\"Now, we'll go upstairs really quietly,\" said Fred, \"and wait for Mum tocall us for breakfast Then, Ron, you come bounding downstairs going,`Mum, look who turned up in the night!' and she'll be all pleased to seeHarry and no one need ever know we flew the car.\"\"Right,\" said Ron. \"Come on, Harry, I sleep at the - at the topRon had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on the house. Theother three wheeled around.Mrs. Weasley was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, andfor a short, plump, kind-faced woman, it was remarkable how muchshe looked like a saber-toothed tiger.29\"Ah, \"said Fred.\"Oh, dear,\" said George.Mrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her hands on her hips,staring from one guilty face to the next. She was wearing a floweredapron with a wand sticking out of the pocket.\"So, \"she said.\"Morning, Mum,\" said George, in what he clearly thought was a jaunty,winning voice.\"Have you any idea how worried I've been?\" said Mrs. Weasley in adeadly whisper.\"Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to -\"All three of Mrs. Weasley's sons were taller than she was, but theycowered as her rage broke over them.\"Beds empty! No note! Cargone - could have crashed - out of mymind with worry - did you care? - never, as long as I've lived -you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like thisfrom Bill or Charlie or Percy -\"\"Perfect Percy,\" muttered Fred.\"YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY'SBOOK!\" yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a finger in Fred's chest. \"Youcould have died, you could have been seen, you could have lost yourfather his job -\"It seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had shouted herselfhoarse before she turned on Harry, who backed away.\"I'm very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,\" she said. \"Come in andhave some breakfast.\"She turned and walked back into the house and Harry, after a nervous30glance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her.The kitchen was small and rather cramped. There was ascrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and Harry sat downon the edge of his seat, looking around. He had never been in a wizardhouse before.The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbersat all. Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Timeto feed the chickens, and You're late. Books were stacked three deep onthe mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese,Enchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts - It's Magic! And unlessHarry's ears were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had justannounced that coming up was \"Witching Hour, with the popularsinging sorceress, Celestina Warbeck.\"Mrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a littlehaphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausagesinto the frying pan. Every now and then she muttered things like \"don'tknow what you were thinking of,\" and \"never would have believed it.\"\"I don't blame you, dear,\" she assured Harry, tipping eight or ninesausages onto his plate. \"Arthur and I have been worried about you,too. Just last night we were saying we'd come and get you ourselves ifyou hadn't written back to Ron by Friday. But really,\" (she was nowadding three fried eggs to his plate) \"flying an illegal car halfwayacross the country - anyone could have seen you -\"She flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which began toclean themselves, clinking gently in the background.\"It was cloudy, Mum!\" said Fred.\"You keep your mouth closed while you're eating!\" Mrs. Weasleysnapped.\"They were starving him, Mum!\" said George.\"And you!\" said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a slightly softenedexpression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it forhim.31At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small,redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen,gave a small squeal, and ran out again.\"Ginny,\" said Ron in an undertone to Harry. \"My sister. She's beentalking about you all summer.\"\"Yeah, she'll be wanting your autograph, Harry,\" Fred said with a grin,but he caught his mother's eye and bent his face over his plate withoutanother word. Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean,which took a surprisingly short time.\"Blimey, I'm tired,\" yawned Fred, setting down his knife and fork at last.\"I think I'll go to bed and -\"\"You will not,\" snapped Mrs. Weasley. \"It's your own fault you'vebeen up all night. You're going to de-gnome the garden for me; they'regetting completely out of hand again -\"\"Oh, Mum -\"\"And you two,\" she said, glaring at Ron and Fred. \"You can go up tobed, dear,\" she added to Harry. \"You didn't ask them to fly thatwretched car -\"But Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, \"I'll help Ron. I'venever seen a de-gnoming -\"\"That's very sweet of you, dear, but it's dull work,\" said Mrs. Weasley.\"Now, let's see what Lockhart's got to say on the subject -\"And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece.George groaned.\"Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden -\"Harry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley's book. Written across itin fancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart's Guide toHousehold Pests. There was a big photograph on the front of a very good-IOI)king wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. As alwaysin the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard, who32Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up atthem all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down at him.\"Oh, he is marvelous,\" she said. \"He knows his household pests, allright, it's a wonderful book . . . .\"\"Mum fancies him,\" said Fred, in a very audible whisper.\"Don't be so ridiculous, Fred,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her cheeks ratherpink. \"All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can goand get on with it, and woe betide you if there's a single gnome in thatgarden when I come out to inspect it.\"Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with Harrybehind them. The garden was large, and in Harry's eyes, exactlYwhat a garden should be. The Dursleys wouldn't have liked it - therewere plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting but there weregnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had never seen spillingfrom every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs.\"Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,\" Harry told Ronthey crossed the lawn.\"Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes,\" said Ron, bentdouble with his head in a peony bush, \"like fat little Santa Clauses withfishing rods . . . .\"There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, andRon straightened up. \"This is a gnome,\" he said grimly.\"Gerroff me! Gerroff me!\" squealed the gnome.It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leatherylooking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. Ron heldit at arm's length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet; hegrasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down.\"This is what you have to do,\" he said. He raised the gnome above hishead (\"Gerroff me!\") and started to swing it in great circles like alasso. Seeing the shocked look on Harry's face, Ron added, \"It doesn'thurt them - you've just got to make them really dizzy so they can't find33their way back to the gnomeholes.\"He let go of the gnome's ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air andlanded with a thud in the field over the hedge.\"Pitiful,\" said Fred. \"I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.\"Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He decidedjust to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome,sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry's finger and hehad a hard job shaking it off - until\"Wow, Harry - that must've been fifty feet ......The air was soon thick with flying gnomes.\"See, they're not too bright,\" said George, seizing five or six gnomes atonce. \"The moment they know the de-gnoming's going on they stormup to have a look. You'd think they'd have learned by now just to stayput.\"Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in astraggling line, their little shoulders hunched.\"They'll be back,\" said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear intothe hedge on the other side of the field. \"They love it here .... Dad'stoo soft with them; he thinks they're funny . . . .\"Just then, the front door slammed.\"He's back!\" said George. \"Dad's home!\"They hurried through the garden and back into the house.Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off andhis eyes closed. He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair hehad was as red as any of his children's. He was wearing long greenrobes, which were dusty and travel-worn.\"What a night,\" he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all satdown around him. \"Nine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus Fletchertried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned ......34Mr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed.\"Find anything, Dad?\" said Fred eagerly.\"All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,\" yawnedMr. Weasley. \"There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn't mydepartment, though. Mortlake was taken away for questioning aboutsome extremely odd ferrets, but that's the Committee on ExperimentalCharms, thank goodness ......\"Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?\" said George.\"Just Muggle-baiting,\" sighed Mr. Weasley. \"Sell them a key thatkeeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it.... Of course, it's very hard to convict anyone because no Mugglewould admit their key keeps shrinking - they'll insist they just keeplosing it. Bless them, they'll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even ifit's staring them in the face .... But the things our lot have taken toenchanting, you wouldn't believe -\"\"LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?\"Mrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. Mr.Weasley's eyes jerked open. He stared guiltily at his wife.\"C-cars, Molly, dear?\"\"Yes, Arthur, cars,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes flashing. \"Imagine awizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to dowith it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he wasenchanting it to make it fly.\"Mr. Weasley blinked.\"Well, dear, I think you'll find that he would be quite within the law todo that, even if - er - he maybe would have done better to, um, tell hiswife the truth .... There's a loophole in the law, you'll find .... As longas he wasn't intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could flywouldn't -\"\"Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you35wrote that law!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley. \"Just so you could carry ontinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed! And for yourinformation, Harry arrived this morning in the car you weren'tintending to fly!\"\"Harry?\" said Mr. Weasley blankly. \"Harry who?\"He looked around, saw Harry, and jumped.\"Good lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet you, Ron's told usso much about -\"\"Your sons flew that car to Harry's house and back last night.\"shouted Mrs. Weasley. \"What have you got to say about that, eh?\"\"Did you really?\" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. \"Did it go all right? I - Imean,\" he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs. Weasley's eyes, \"that -that was very wrong, boys - very wrong indeed ......\"Let's leave them to it,\" Ron muttered to Harry as Mrs. Weasleyswelled like a bullfrog. \"Come on, I'll show you my bedroom.\"They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to anuneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging upthrough the house. On the third landing, a door stood ajar. Harry justcaught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before itclosed with a snap.\"Ginny,\" said Ron. \"You don't know how weird it is for her to be thisshy. She never shuts up normally -\"They climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peelingpaint and a small plaque on it, saying RONALD'S ROOM.Harry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, andblinked. It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in Ron'sroom seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, thewalls, even the ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had coverednearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the sameseven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying36broomsticks, and waving energetically.\"Your Quidditch team?\" said Harry.\"The Chudley Cannons,\" said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread,which was emblazoned with two giant black C's and a speedingcannonball. \"Ninth in the league.\"Ron's school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to apile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of MartinMiggs, the Mad Muggle. Ron's magic wand was lying on top of a fishtank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat,Scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun.Harry stepped over a pack of Self-Shuffling playing cards on the floorand looked out of the tiny window. In the field far below he could seea gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys'hedge. Then he turned to look at Ron, who was watching him almostnervously, as though waiting for his opinion.\"It's a bit small,\" said Ron quickly. \"Not like that room you hadwith the Muggles. And I'm right underneath the ghoul in the attic;he's always banging on the pipes and groaning ......But Harry, grinning widely, said, \"This is the best house I've everbeen in.\"Ron's ears went pink. .AND BLOTTSife at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on PrivetDrive. The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys'house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock thefirst time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and itshouted, \"Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!\" The ghoul in the attic howledand dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, andsmall explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were consideredperfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's,however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was thefact that everybody there seemed to like him.37Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force himto eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sitnext to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him withquestions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how thingslike plugs and the postal service worked.42\"Fascinating.\" he would say as Harry talked him through using atelephone. \"Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found ofgetting along without magic.\"Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after hehad arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to findMr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table.The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridgebowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone toknocking things over whenever Harry entered a room. She dived underthe table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing likethe setting sun. Pretending he hadn't noticed this, Harry sat down andtook the toast Mrs. Weasley offered him.\"Letters from school,\" said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ronidentical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink.\"Dumbledore already knows you're here, Harry - doesn't miss a trick,that man. You two've got them, too,\" he added, as Fred and Georgeambled in, still in their pajamas.For a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters.Harry's told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King'sCross station on September first. There was also a list of the newbooks he'd need for the coming year.SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE:The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2by Miranda Goshawk38Break with a Banshee by Gilderoy LockhartGadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy LockhartHolidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart4 \",3Travels with Trolls by Gilderoy LockhartVoyages with Vampires by Gilderoy LockhartWanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy LockhartYear with the Yeti by Gilderoy LockhartFred, who had finished his own list, peered over at Harry's.\"You've been told to get all Lockhart's books, too!\" he said. \"The newDefense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan - bet it's awitch.\"At this point, Fred caught his mother's eye and quickly busied himselfwith the marmalade.\"That lot won't come cheap,\" said George, with a quick look at hisparents. \"Lockhart's books are really expensive ......\"Well, we'll manage,\" said Mrs. Weasley, but she looked worried. \"Iexpect we'll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny's things secondhand.\"\"Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?\" Harry asked Ginny.She nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put herelbow in the butter dish. Fortunately no one saw this except Harry,because just then Ron's elder brother Percy walked in. He wasalready dressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweatervest.\"Morning, all,\" said Percy briskly. \"Lovely day.\"He sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almostimmediately, pulling from underneath him a moulting, gray featherduster - at least, that was what Harry thought it was, until he saw thatit was breathing.* 4439\"Errol!\" said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting aletter from under its wing. \"Finally - he's got Hermione's answer. Iwrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from theDursleys.\"He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried tostand him on it, but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron lay him onthe draining board instead, muttering, \"Pathetic.\" Then he rippedopen Hermione's letter and read it out loud:\"`Dear Ron, and Harry if you're there,\"`I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and thatyou didn't do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that wouldget Harry into trouble, too. I've been really worried and if Harry is allright, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl because I think another delivery mightfinish your one off.\"'I'm very busy with schoolwork, of course'- How can she be?\" said Ronin horror. \"We're on vacation! - 'and we're going to London nextWednesday to buy my new books. Why don't we meet in Diago n Alley?\"`Let me know what's happening as soon as you can. Love from Hermione.\"'\"Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,\"said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table. \"What're you all up totoday?\"Harry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to asmall paddock the Weasleys owned. It was surrounded by trees thatblocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they couldpractice Quidditch there, as long as they didn't fly too high.* 4$They couldn't use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard toexplain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; insteadthey threw apples for one another to catch. They took turns ridingHarry's Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom;40Ron's old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies.Five minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks overtheir shoulders. They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them, buthe had said he was busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes sofar; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time.\"Wish I knew what he was up to,\" said Fred, frowning. \"He's nothimself. His exam results came the day before you did; twelveO.WL.s and he hardly gloated at all.\"\"Ordinary Wizarding Levels,\" George explained, seeing Harry'spuzzled look. \"Bill got twelve, too. If we're not careful, we'll haveanother Head Boy in the family. I don't think I could stand the shame.\"Bill was the oldest Weasley brother. He and the next brother, Charlie,had already left Hogwarts. Harry had never met either of them, butknew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egyptworking for the wizard's bank, Gringotts.\"Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff thisyear,\" said George after a while. \"Five sets of Lockhart books! AndGinny needs robes and a wand and everything ......Harry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in an undergroundvault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his parents hadleft him. Of course, it was only in the wizarding world that he hadmoney; you couldn't use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts46in Muggle shops. He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank accountto the Dursleys; he didn't think their horror of anything connected withmagic would stretch to a large pile of gold.Mrs. Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday. After aquick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coatsand Mrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece andpeered inside.\"We're running low, Arthur,\" she sighed. \"We'll have to buy somemore today... Ah well, guests first! After you, Harry dear!\"41And she offered him the flowerpot.Harry stared at them all watching him.\"W-what am I supposed to do?\" he stammered.\"He's never traveled by Floo powder,\" said Ron suddenly. \"Sorry,Harry, I forgot.\"\"Never?\" said Mr. Weasley. \"But how did you get to Diagon Alley tobuy your school things last year?\"\"I went on the Underground -\"\"Really?\" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. \"Were there escapators? Howexactly -\"\"Not now, Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Floo powder's a lot quicker,dear, but goodness me, if you've never used it before -\"\"He'll be all right, Mum,\" said Fred. \"Harry, watch us first.\"He took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped upto the fire, and threw the powder into the flames.With a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred,who stepped right into it, shouted, \"Diagon Alley!\" and vanished.* 41\"You must speak clearly, dear,\" Mrs. Weasley told Harry as Georgedipped his hand into the flowerpot. \"And be sure to get out at the rightgrate ......\"The right what?\" said Harry nervously as the fire roared and whippedGeorge out of sight, too.\"Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know,but as long as you've spoken clearly -\"\"He'll be fine, Molly, don't fuss,\" said Mr. Weasley, helping himself to42Floo powder, too.\"But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt anduncle?\"\"They wouldn't mind,\" Harry reassured her. \"Dudley would think itwas a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don't worry about that -\"\"Well ... all right ... you go after Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Now,when you get into the fire, say where you're going\"And keep your elbows tucked in,\" Ron advised.\"And your eyes shut,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"The soot -\"\"Don't fidget,\" said Ron. \"Or you might well fall out of the wrongfireplace -\"\"But don't panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred andGeorge.\"Trying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a pinch of Floo powderand walked to the edge of the fire. He took a deep breath, scatteredthe powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like awarm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lotof hot ash.\"D-Dia-gon Alley,\" he coughed.48It felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain. He seemedto be spinning very fast - the roaring in his ears was deafening -hetried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made himfeel sick - something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it intightly, still spinning and spinning - now it felt as though cold handswere slapping his face - squinting through his glasses he saw a blurredstream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond - hisbacon sandwiches were churning inside him - he closed his eyes againwishing it would stop, and thenHe fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses43snap.Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holdinghis broken glasses up to his eyes. He was -,cite alone, but where hewas, he had no idea. All he could tell was that he was standing in thestone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard's shop - butnothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list.A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstainedpack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared downfrom the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter,and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. Even worse, thedark, narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop windowwas definitely not Diagon Alley.The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where ithad hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward thedoor, but before he'd got halfway toward it, two people appeared onthe other side of the glass - and one of them was the49very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered insoot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to hisleft; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crackto peer through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped intothe shop.The man who followed could only be Draco's father. He had the samepale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossedthe shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on thecounter before turning to his son and saying, \"Touch nothing, Draco.\"Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, \"I thought you weregoing to buy me a present.\"\"I said I would buy you a racing broom,\" said his father, drumming hisfingers on the counter.\"What's the good of that if I'm not on the House team?\" said Malfoy,44looking sulky and bad-tempered. \"Harry Potter got a Nimbus TwoThousand last year. Special permission from Dumbledore so he couldplay for Gryffindor. He's not even that good, it's just because he'sfamous ... famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead . . . .\"Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls.\". . . everyone thinks he's so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar andhis broomstick -\"\"You have told me this at least a dozen times already,\" said Mr.Malfoy, with a quelling look at his son. \"And I would remind you that itis not - prudent - to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not whenmost of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lorddisappear - ah, Mr. Borgin.\"50A stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing hisgreasy hair back from his face.\"Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,\" said Mr. Borgin in avoice as oily as his hair. \"Delighted - and young Master Malfoy, too -charmed. How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today,and very reasonably priced -\"\"I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,\" said Mr. Malfoy.\"Selling?\" The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin's face.\"You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting moreraids,\" said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his insidepocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read. \"I have a few - ah -items at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call......Mr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and looked down thelist.\"The Ministry wouldn't presume to trouble you, sir, surely?\"Mr. Malfoy's lip curled.45\"I have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still commands acertain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. Thereare rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act - no doubt that fleabitten,Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind itHarry felt a hot surge of anger.\"- and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it appear -\"\"I understand, sir, of course,\" said Mr. Borgin. \"Let me see. . .\"\"Can I have that?\" interrupted Draco, pointing at the withered hand onits cushion.51\"Ah, the Hand of Glory!\" said Mr. Borgin, abandoning Mr. Malfoy'slist and scurrying over to Draco. \"Insert a candle and it gives light onlyto the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has finetaste, sir.\"\"I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer,Borgin,\" said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, \"Nooffense, sir, no offense meant -\"\"Though if his grades don't pick up,\" said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still,\"that may indeed be all he is fit for -\"\"It's not my fault,\" retorted Draco. \"The teachers all have favorites,that Hermione Granger -\"\"I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard familybeat you in every exam,\" snapped Mr. Malfoy.\"Ha!\" said Harry under his breath, pleased to see Draco looking bothabashed and angry.\"It's the same all over,\" said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice. \"Wizardblood is counting for less everywhere -\"\"Not with me,\" said Mr. Malfoy, his long nostrils flaring.46\"No, sir, nor with me, sir,\" said Mr. Borgin, with a deep bow.\"In that case, perhaps we can return to my list,\" said Mr. Malfoyshortly. \"I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have importantbusiness elsewhere today -\"They started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as Draco drewnearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale.Draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman's rope and to read,smirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals,Caution: Do Not Touch. Cursed - Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen MuggleOwners to Date.* 52Draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him. Hewalked forward - he stretched out his hand for the handle\"Done,\" said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. \"Come, Draco -\"Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away.\"Good day to you, Mr. Borgin. I'll expect you at the manor tomorrowto pick up the goods.\"The moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped his oily manner.\"Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, youhaven't sold me half of what's hidden in your manor ......Muttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back room. Harrywaited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could,slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shopdoor.Clutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared around. He hademerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely ofshops devoted to the Dark Arts. The one he'd just left, Borgin andBurkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty windowdisplay of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage wasalive with gigantic black spiders. Two shabby-looking wizards were47watching him from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other.Feeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hold his glasses on straight andhoping against hope he'd be able to find a way out of here.An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonouscandles told him he was in Knockturn Alley. This didn't help, as Harryhad never heard of such a place. He supposed he hadn't spokenclearly enough through his mouthful of ashesback in the Weasleys' fire. Trying to stay calm, he wondered what todo.\"Not lost are you, my dear?\" said a voice in his ear, making him jump.An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what lookedhorribly like whole human fingernails. She leered at him, showingmossy teeth. Harry backed away.\"I'm fine, thanks,\" he said. \"I'm just -\"\"HARRY! What d'yeh think yer doin' down there?\"Harry's heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascadeddown over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, theHogwarts gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyesflashing over his great bristling beard.\"Hagrid!\" Harry croaked in relief. \"I was lost - Floo powder -\"Hagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him awayfrom the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands. Her shrieksfollowed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into brightsunlight. Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in thedistance - Gringotts Bank. Hagrid had steered him right into DiagonAlley.\"Yer a mess!\" said Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off Harry soforcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outsidean apothecary. \"Skulkin' around Knockturn Alley, I dunno dodgy place,Harry - don' want no one ter see yeh down there -\"48\"I realized that,\" said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made to brush him offagain. \"I told you, I was lost - what were you doing down there,anyway?\"* 54\"I was lookin' fer a Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent,\" growled Hagrid.\"They're ruinin' the school cabbages. Yer not on yer own?\"\"I'm staying with the Weasleys but we got separated,\" Harry explained.\"I've got to go and find them . . . .\"They set off together down the street.\"How come yeh never wrote back ter me?\" said Hagrid as Harryjogged alongside him (he had to take three steps to every stride ofHagrid's enormous boots). Harry explained all about Dobby and theDursleys.\"Lousy Muggles,\" growled Hagrid. \"If I'd've known -\"\"Harry! Harry! Over here!\"Harry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of thewhite flight of steps to Gringotts. She ran down to meet them, herbushy brown hair flying behind her.\"What happened to your glasses? Hello, Hagrid - Oh, it's wonderful tosee you two again - Are you coming into Gringotts, Harry?\"\"As soon as I've found the Weasleys,\" said Harry.\"Yeh won't have long ter wait,\" Hagrid said with a grin.Harry and Hermione looked around: Sprinting up the crowded streetwere Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and Mr. Weasley.\"Harry,\" Mr. Weasley panted. \"We hoped you'd only gone onegrate too far . He mopped his glistening bald patch. \"Molly's49frantic - she's coming now -\"\"Where did you come out?\" Ron asked.\"Knockturn Alley,\" said Hagrid grimly.\"Excellent.\" said Fred and George together.\"We've never been allowed in,\" said Ron enviously.*55*\"I should ruddy well think not,\" growled Hagrid.Mrs. Weasley now came galloping into view, her handbag swinging wildly in one hand, Ginny just clinging onto the other.\"Oh, Harry - oh, my dear - you could have been anywhere -\"Gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of herbag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid hadn't managed tobeat away. Mr. Weasley took Harry's glasses, gave them a tap of hiswand, and returned them, good as new.\"Well, gotta be off,\" said Hagrid, who was having his handwrung by Mrs. Weasley (\"Knockturn Alley! If you hadn't foundhim, Hagrid!\"). \"See yer at Hogwarts!\" And he strode away, headand shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street.\"Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?\" Harry asked Ron andHermione as they climbed the Gringotts steps. \"Malfoy and his father.\"\"Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything?\" said Mr. Weasley sharplybehind them.\"No, he was selling ='\"So he's worried,\" said Mr. Weasley with grim satisfaction. \"Oh,I'd love to get Lucius Malfoy for something ......\"You be careful, Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley sharply as they werebowed into the bank by a goblin at the door. \"That family's trouble. Don't go biting off more than you can chew -\"\"So you don't think I'm a match for Lucius Malfoy?\" said Mr.Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by thesight of Hermione's parents, who were standing nervously at thecounter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting forHermione to introduce them.50,5 s\"But you're Muggles!\" said Mr. Weasley delightedly. \"We must have a drink!What's that you've got there? Oh, you're changing Muggle money. Molly,look!\" He pointed excitedly at the tenpound notes in Mr. Granger's hand.\"Meet you back here,\" Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harrywere led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin.The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that spedalong miniature train tracks through the bank's underground tunnels.Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys' vault, but feltdreadful, far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley, when it was opened.There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one gold Galleon.Mrs. Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot intoher bag. Harry felt even worse when they reached his vault. He tried toblock the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into aleather bag.Back outside on the marble steps, they all separated. Percy mutteredvaguely about needing a new quill. Fred and George had spotted theirfriend from Hogwarts, Lee Jordan. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were going toa secondhand robe shop. Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangersoff to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink.\"We'll all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks,\"said Mrs. Weasley, setting off with Ginny. \"And not one step downKnockturn Alley!\" she shouted at the twins' retreating backs.Harry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the winding, cobbled street.The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully*57*in Harry's pocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought threelarge strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they slurpedhappily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinatingshop windows. Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies untilHermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door.In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, George,and Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster's Fabulous51Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potionstains they found Percy, deeply immersed in a small and deeplyboring book called Prefects Who Gained Power.`A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers, \" Ron readaloud off the back cover. \"That sounds fascinating . . . .\"\"Go away,\" Percy snapped.\"'Course, he's very ambitious, Percy, he's got it all plannedout .... He wants to be Minister of Magic. . . \" Ron told Harryand Hermione in an undertone as they left Percy to it.An hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts. They were byno means the only ones making their way to the bookshop. As theyapproached it, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors, trying to get in. The reason for this was proclaimedby a large banner stretched across the upper windows:GILDEROY LOCKHARTwill be signing copies of his autobiographyMAGICAL MEtoday 12:30 P.m. to 4:30 P.m.\"We can actually meet him!\" Hermione squealed. \"I mean, he'swritten almost the whole booklist!\"The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs.Weasley's age. A harrassed-looking wizard stood at the door, saying,\"Calmly, please, ladies .... Don't push, there ... mind the books, now . .. . \"Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed inside. A long line woundright to the back of the shop, where Gilderoy Lockhart was signinghis books. They each grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells,Grade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleyswere standing with Mr. and Mrs. Granger.\"Oh, there you are, good,\" said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded breathlessand kept patting her hair. \"We'll be able to see him in a minute ......Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a table surroundedby large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly52white teeth at the crowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes offorget-me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard'shat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair.A short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographswith a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke withevery blinding flash.\"Out of the way, there,\" he snarled at Ron, moving back to get a bettershot. \"This is for the Daily Prophet -\"\"Big deal,\" said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer hadstepped on it.Gilderoy Lockhart heard him. He looked up. He saw Ron*59*and then he saw Harry. He stared. Then he leapt to his feet and positivelyshouted, \"It can't be Harry Potter?\"The crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart dived forward, seizedHarry's arm, and pulled him to the front. The crowd burst into applause.Harry's face burned as Lockhart shook his hand for the photographer, whowas clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the Weasleys.\"Nice big smile, Harry,\" said Lockhart, through his own gleaming teeth.\"Together, you and I are worth the front page.\"When he finally let go of Harry's hand, Harry could hardly feel his fingers.He tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys, but Lockhart threw an armaround his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side.\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said loudly, waving for quiet. \"What anextraordinary moment this is! The perfect moment for me to make a littleannouncement I've been sitting on for some time!\"When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, he onlywanted to buy my autobiography -which I shall be happy to present himnow, free of charge-\" The crowd applauded again. \"He had no idea,\"Lockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to53the end of his nose, \"that he would shortly be getting much, much morethan my book, Magical Me. He and his schoolmates will, in fact, be gettingthe real magical me. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure andpride in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post ofDefense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraftand Wizardry!\"The crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being60presented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart. Staggeringslightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of thelimelight to the edge of the room, where Ginny was standing next toher new cauldron.\"You have these,\" Harry mumbled to her, tipping the books into thecauldron. \"I'll buy my own -\"\"Bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter?\" said a voice Harry had notrouble recognizing. He straightened up and found himself face-to-facewith Draco Malfoy, who was wearing his usual sneer.\"Famous Harry Potter,\" said Malfoy. \"Can't even go into a bookshopwithout making the front page.\"\"Leave him alone, he didn't want all that!\" said Ginny. It was the firsttime she had spoken in front of Harry. She was glaring at Malfoy.\"Potter, you've got yourself a girlfriend!\" drawled Malfoy. Ginny wentscarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both clutchingstacks of Lockhart's books.\"Oh, it's you,\" said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were somethingunpleasant on the sole of his shoe. \"Bet you're surprised to see Harryhere, eh?\"\"Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,\" retortedMalfoy. \"I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay forall those.\"Ron went as red as Ginny. He dropped his books into the cauldron,54too, and started toward Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione grabbed theback of his jacket.\"Ron!\" said Mr. Weasley, struggling over with Fred and George.\"What are you doing? It's too crowded in here, let's go outside.\"61\"Well, well, well - Arthur Weasley.\"It was Mr. Malfoy. He stood with his hand on Draco's shoulder,sneering in just the same way.\"Lucius,\" said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly.\"Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,\" said Mr. Malfoy. \"All those raids... I hope they're paying you overtime?\"He reached into Ginny's cauldron and extracted, from amid the glossyLockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of A Beginner's Guideto Transfiguration.\"Obviously not,\" Mr. Malfoy said. \"Dear me, what's the use of being adisgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it?\"Mr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny.\"We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard,Malfoy,\" he said.\"Clearly,\" said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr. and Mrs.Granger, who were watching apprehensively. \"The company youkeep, Weasley ... and I thought your family could sink no lower ='There was a thud of metal as Ginny's cauldron went flying; Mr.Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him backwardinto a bookshelf. Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering downon all their heads; there was a yell of, \"Get him, Dad!\" from Fred orGeorge; Mrs. Weasley was shrieking, \"No, Arthur, no!\"; the crowdstampeded backward, knocking more shelves over; \"Gentlemen,please - please!\" cried the assistant, and then, louder than all55\"Break it up, there, gents, break it up -\"62Hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books. In an instant he hadpulled Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy apart. Mr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr.Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools. He was stillholding Ginny's old Transfiguration book. He thrust it at her, his eyesglittering with malice.\"Here, girl - take your book - it's the best your father can give you -\" Pullinghimself out of Hagrid's grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop.\"Yeh should've ignored him, Arthur,\" said Hagrid, almost lifting Mr. Weasleyoff his feet as he straightened his robes. \"Rotten ter the core, the whole family,everyone knows that - no Malfoy's worth listenin' ter - bad blood, that's what itis - come on now - let's get outta here.\"The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barelycame up to Hagrid's waist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried up thestreet, the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs. Weasley beside herself withfury.\"A fine example to set for your children . . . brawling in public . . . whatGilderoy Lockhart must've thought -\"\"He was pleased,\" said Fred. \"Didn't you hear him as we were leaving? He wasasking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he'd be able to work the fight intohis report - said it was all publicity -\"But it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the LeakyCauldron, where Harry, the Weasleys, and all their shopping would betraveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder. They said good-bye to theGrangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side;Mr. Weasley started to ask63them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs.Weasley's face.Harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before56helping himself to Floo powder. It definitely wasn't his favorite way totravel.WILLOWhe end of the summer vacation came too quickly for Harry's liking.He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but his monthat the Burrow had been the happiest of his life. It was difficult not tofeel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort ofwelcome he could expect next time he turned up on Privet Drive.On their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinnerthat included all of Harry's favorite things, ending with amouthwatering treacle pudding. Fred and George rounded off theevening with a display of Filibuster fireworks; they fiIled the kitchenwith red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at leasthalf an hour. Then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate andbed.It took a long while to get started next morning. They were up atdawn, but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do.65Mrs. Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks andquills; people kept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits of toastin their hands; and Mr. Weasley nearly broke his neck, tripping over astray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying Ginny's trunk to the car.Harry couldn't see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and arat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia. He had reckoned, ofcourse, without the special features that Mr. Weasley had added.\"Not a word to Molly,\" he whispered to Harry as he opened the. trunkand showed him how it had been magically expanded so that theluggage fitted easily.57When at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley glanced into theback seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Percy were all sittingcomfortably side by side, and said, \"Muggles do know more than wegive them credit for, don't they?\" She and Ginny got into the front seat,which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench. \"I mean,you'd never know it was this roomy from the outside, would you?\"Mr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard,Harry turning back for a last look at the house. He barely had time towonder when he'd see it again when they were back George hadforgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks. Five minutes after that, theyskidded to a halt in the yard so that Fred could run in for hisbroomstick. They had almost reached the highway when Ginnyshrieked that she'd left her diary. By the time she had clambered backinto the car, they were running very late, and tempers were runninghigh.* 66Mr. Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife.\"Molly, dear -\"\"No, Arthur -\"\"No one would see - this little button here is an Invisibility Booster Iinstalled - that'd get us up in the air - then we fly above the clouds.We'd be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser -\"\"I said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight -\"They reached King's Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mr. Weasleydashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they allhurried into the station.Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year. The trickypart was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn'tvisible to the Muggle eye. What you had to do was walk through thesolid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. It didn't hurt, but it had tobe done carefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing.\"Percy first,\" said Mrs. Weasley, looking nervously at the clock58overhead, which showed they had only five minutes to disappearcasually through the barrier.Percy strode briskly forward and vanished. Mr. Weasley went next;Fred and George followed.\"I'll take Ginny and you two come right after us,\" Mrs. Weasley toldHarry and Ron, grabbing Ginny's hand and setting off. In the blink ofan eye they were gone.\"Let's go together, we've only got a minute,\" Ron said to Harry.Harry made sure that Hedwig's cage was safely wedged on top of histrunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier. He felt61perfectly confident; this wasn't nearly as uncomfortable as using Floopowder. Both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys andwalked purposefully toward the barrier, gathering speed. A few feetaway from it, they broke into a run andCRASH.Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron's trunk felloff with a loud thump, Harry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig'scage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shriekingindignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled,\"What in blazes d'you think you're doing?\"\"Lost control of the trolley,\" Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as hegot up. Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who was causing such a scenethat there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from thesurrounding crowd.\"Why can't we get through?\" Harry hissed to Ron.\"I dunno -\"Ron looked wildly around. A dozen curious people were stillwatching them.59\"We're going to miss the train,\" Ron whispered. \"I don't understandwhy the gateway's sealed itself -\"Harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pitof his stomach. Ten seconds ... nine seconds ...He wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against thebarrier and pushed with all his might. The metal remained solid.Three seconds . . . two seconds ... one second ...\"It's gone,\" said Ron, sounding stunned. \"The train's left. What ifMum and Dad can't get back through to us? Have you got anyMuggle money?\"68And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out ofthe station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia wasparked.Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand.They heaved their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, andgot into the front.\"Check that no one's watching,\" said Ron, starting the ignition withanother tap of his wand. Harry stuck his head out of the window:Traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street wasempty.\"Okay,\" he said.Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car aroundthem vanished - and so did they. Harry could feel the seat vibratingbeneath him, hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and hisglasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had become a pair ofeyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full ofparked cars.\"Let's go,\" said Ron's voice from his right.And the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away,60dropping out of sight as the car rose; in seconds, the whole of Londonlay, smoky and glittering, below them.Then there was a popping noise and the car, Harry, and Ronreappeared.\"Uh-oh,\" said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster. \"It's faulty -\"Both of them pummeled it. The car vanished. Then it flickered backagain.\"Hold on!\" Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the acceler* 7 0ator; they shot straight into the low, woolly clouds and everythingturned dull and foggy.\"Now what?\" said Harry, blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressingin on them from all sides.\"We need to see the train to know what direction to go in,\" said Ron.\"Dip back down again - quickly -\"They dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in theirseats, squinting at the ground.\"I can see it!\" Harry yelled. \"Right ahead - there!\"The Hogwarts Express was streaking along below them like a scarletsnake.\"Due north,\" said Ron, checking the compass on the dashboard.\"Okay, we'll just have to check on it every half hour or so - hold onAnd they shot up through the clouds. A minute later, they burst outinto a blaze of sunlight.It was a different world. The wheels of the car skimmed the sea offluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun.61\"All we've got to worry about now are airplanes,\" said Ron.They looked at each other and started to laugh; for a long time, theycouldn't stop.It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream. This,thought Harry, was surely the only way to travel - past swirls andturrets of snowy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fatpack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the prospect of seeingFred's and George's jealous faces when they* 71landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front ofHogwarts castle.They made regular checks on the train as they flew farther andfarther north, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a differentview. London was soon far behind them, replaced by neat greenfields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alivewith cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy churches.Several uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to admit thatsome of the fun was wearing off. The toffees had made themextremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink. He and Ron hadpulled off their sweaters, but Harry's T-shirt was sticking to the backof his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweatynose. He had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now andwas thinking longingly of the train miles below, where you could buyice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch. Whyhadn't they been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters?\"Can't be much further, can it?\" croaked Ron, hours later still, as thesun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink.\"Ready for another check on the train?\"It was still right below them, winding its way past a snowcappedmountain. It was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds.Ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again,but as he did so, the engine began to whine.62Harry and Ron exchanged nervous glances.\"It's probably just tired,\" said Ron. \"It's never been this far before......12And they both pretended not to notice the whining growinglouder and louder as the sky became steadily darker. Stars wereblossoming in the blackness. Harry pulled his sweater back on, trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly, as though in protest.\"Not far,\" said Ron, more to the car than to Harry, \"not farnow,\" and he patted the dashboard nervously.When they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later, theyhad to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew.\"There!\" Harry shouted, making Ron and Hedwig jump.\"Straight ahead!\"Silhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake,stood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle.But the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed.\"Come on,\" Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering wheel a little shake, \"nearly there, come on -\"The engine groaned. Narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood. Harry found himself gripping the edges of his seatvery hard as they flew toward the lake.The car gave a nasty wobble. Glancing out of his window, Harrysaw the smooth, black, glassy surface of the water, a mile below.Ron's knuckles were white on the steering wheel. The car wobbledagain.\"Come on,\" Ron muttered.They were over the lake - the castle was right ahead - Ronput his foot down.There was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died completely.\"Uh-oh,\" said Ron, into the silence.The nose of the car dropped. They were falling, gathering speed,heading straight for the solid castle wall.\"Noooooo!\" Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they63missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc,soaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and thenout over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time.Ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out ofhis back pocket\"STOP! STOP!\" he yelled, whacking the dashboard and thewindshield, but they were still plummeting, the ground flying up towardthem\"WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!\" Harry bellowed, lunging for thesteering wheel, but too lateCRUNCH.With an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit the thick treetrunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt. Steam wasbillowing from under the crumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking interror; a golfball-size lump was throbbing on Harry's head where hehad hit the windshield; and to his right, Ron let out a low, despairinggroan.\"Are you okay?\" Harry said urgently.\"My wand,\" said Ron, in a shaky voice. \"Look at my wand -\"It had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held on by afew splinters.Harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they'd be able to mend itup at the school, but he never even got started. At that very moment,something hit his side of the car with the force of a* Y4 *charging bull, sending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as anequally heavy blow hit the roof.\"What's happen -?\"Ron gasped, staring through the windshield, and Harry looked around64just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it. The treethey had hit was attacking them. Its trunk was bent almost double, andits gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it couldreach.\"Aaargh!\" said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent intohis door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows fromknuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram waspounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving\"Run for it!\" Ron shouted, throwing his full weight against his door, butnext second he had been knocked backward into Harry's lap by avicious uppercut from another branch.\"We're done for!\" he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly thefloor of the car was vibrating - the engine had restarted.\"Reverse!\" Harry yelled, and the car shot backward; the tree was stilltrying to hit them; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost rippeditself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach.\"That,\" panted Ron, \"was close. Well done, car -\"The car, however, had reached the end of its tether. With two sharpclunks, the doors flew open and Harry felt his seat tip sideways: Nextthing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground. Loud thuds toldhim that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk; Hedwig'scage flew through the air and burst open; she rose out of it with anangry screech and sped off toward the castleY5without a backward look. Then, dented, scratched, and steaming,the car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily.\"Come back!\" Ron yelled after it, brandishing his broken wand.\"Dad'll kill me!\"But the car disappeared from view with one last snort from itsexhaust.\"Can you believe our luck?\" said Ron miserably, bending down to65pick up Scabbers. \"Of all the trees we could've hit, we had to getone that hits back.\"He glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree, which was stillflailing its branches threateningly.\"Come on,\" said Harry wearily, \"we'd better get up to the school......It wasn't at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured. Stiff, cold,and bruised, they seized the ends of their trunks and began draggingthem up the grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors.\"I think the feast's already started,\" said Ron, dropping his trunk atthe foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through abrightly lit window. \"Hey - Harry - come and look - it's the Sorting!\"Harry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered in at the GreatHall.Innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long,crowded tables, making the golden plates and goblets sparkle.Overhead, the bewitched ceiling, which always mirrored the skyoutside, sparkled with stars.Through the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats, Harry saw a longline of scared-looking first years fiIing into the Hall. Ginny* 76was among them, easily visible because of her vivid Weasley ha-ir.Meanwhile, Professor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hairin a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on astool before the newcomers.Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted newstudents into the four Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff,Ravenclaw, and Slytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on,exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its decision as itmuttered aloud in his ear. For a few horrible seconds he had fearedthat the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the house that hadturned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other -but he had66ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione, and the rest of theWeasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win theHouse Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in sevenyears.A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place thehat on his head. Harry's eyes wandered past him to where ProfessorDumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the stafftable, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in thecandlelight. Several seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart,dressed in robes of aquamarine. And there at the end was Hagrid,huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet.\"Hang on. . . \" Harry muttered to Ron. \"There's an empty chair at thestaff table .... Where's Snape?\"Professor Severus Snape was Harry's least favorite teacher. Harryalso happened to be Snape's least favorite student. Cruel, sarcastic,and disliked by everybody except the students from his own house(Slytherin), Snape taught Potions.\"Maybe he's ill!\" said Ron hopefully.\"Maybe he's left,\" said Ha-rry, \"because he missed out on the DefenseAgainst Dark Arts job again!\"\"Or he might have been sacked!\" said Ron enthusiastically. \"I mean,everyone hates him -\"\"Or maybe,\" said a very cold voice right behind them, \"he's waiting tohear why you two didn't arrive on the school train.\"Harry spun around. There, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze,stood Severus Snape. He was a thin man with sallow skin, a hookednose, and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, hewas smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deeptrouble.\"Follow me,\" said Snape.Not daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron followed Snapeup the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with67flaming torches. A delicious smell of food was wafting from the GreatHall, but Snape led them away from the warmth and light, down anarrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons.\"In!\" he said, opening a door halfway down the cold passageway andpointing.They entered Snape's office, shivering. The shadowy walls were linedwith shelves of large glass) ars, in which floated all manner ofrevolting things Harry didn't really want to know the name of at themoment. The fireplace was dark and empty. Snape closed the doorand turned to look at them.\"So,\" he said softly, \"the train isn't good enough for the famous HarryPotter and his faithful sidekick Weasley. Wanted to arrive with a bang,did we, boys?\"\"No, sir, it was the barrier at King's Cross, it -\"78\"Silence!\" said Snape coldly. \"What have you done with thecar?\"Ron gulped. This wasn't the first time Snape had given Harry theimpression of being able to read minds. But a moment later, he understood, as Snape unrolled today's issue of the Evening Prophet.\"You were seen,\" he hissed, showing them the headline: FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. He began to readaloud: \"Two Muggles in London, convinced they saw an old carflying over the Post Office tower ... at noon in Norfolk, Mrs.Hetty Bayliss, while hanging out her washing ... Mr. Angus Fleet,of Peebles, reported to police ... Six or seven Muggles in all. I believe your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office?\"he said, looking up at Ron and smiling still more nastily. \"Dear,dear ... his own son. . . \"Harry felt as though he'd just been walloped in the stomach byone of the mad tree's larger branches. If anyone found out Mr.Weasley had bewitched the car ... he hadn't thought of that ....\"I noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable damageseems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow,\"Snape went on.\"That tree did more damage to us than we -\" Ron blurted out.68\"Silence!\" snapped Snape again. \"Most unfortunately, you arenot in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest withme. I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power.You will wait here.\"Harry and Ron stared at each other, white-faced. Harry didn'tfeel hungry any more. He now felt extremely sick. He tried not tolook at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on ashelf behind Snape's desk. If Snape had gone to fetch ProfessorMcGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, they were hardly any betteroff. She might be fairer than Snape, but she was still extremely strict.Ten minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough it was ProfessorMcGonagall who accompanied him. Harry had seen ProfessorMcGonagall angry on several occasions, but either he had forgottenjust how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen her this angrybefore. She raised her wand the moment she entered; Harry and Ronboth flinched, but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, whereflames suddenly erupted.\"Sit,\" she said, and they both backed into chairs by the fire.\"Explain,\" she said, her glasses glinting ominously.Ron launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the stationrefusing to let them through.\"-so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn't get on the train.\"\"Why didn't you send us a letter by owl? I believe you have an owl?\"Professor McGonagall said coldly to Harry.Harry gaped at her. Now she said it, that seemed the obvious thing tohave done.\"I - I didn't think -\"\"That,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"is obvious.\"There was a knock on the office door and Snape, now looking happier69than ever, opened it. There stood the headmaster, ProfessorDumbledore.Harry's whole body went numb. Dumbledore was looking unusuallygrave. He stared down his very crooked nose at them, and*80*Harry suddenly found himself wishing he and Ron were still beingbeaten up by the Whomping Willow.There was a long silence. Then Dumbledore said, \"Please explain whyyou did this.\"It would have been better if he had shouted. Harry hated thedisappointment in his voice. For some reason, he was unable to lookDumbledore in the eyes, and spoke instead to his knees. He toldDumbledore everything except that Mr. Weasley owned thebewitched car, making it sound as though he and Ron had happened tofind a flying car parked outside the station. He knew Dumbledorewould see through this at once, but Dumbledore asked no questionsabout the car. When Harry had finished, he merely continued to peerat them through his spectacles.\"We'll go and get our stuff,\" said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice.\"What are you talking about, Weasley?\" barked ProfessorMcGonagall.\"Well, you're expelling us, aren't you?\" said Ron.Harry looked quickly at Dumbledore.\"Not today, Mr. Weasley,\" said Dumbledore. \"But I must impress uponboth of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing toboth your families tonight. I must also warn you that if you do anythinglike this again, I will have no choice but to expel you.\"Snape looked as though Christmas had been canceled. He cleared histhroat and said, \"Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted theDecree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused seriousdamage to an old and valuable tree - surely acts of this nature -\"70* 8i\"It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys'punishments, Severus,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"They are in herHouse and are therefore her responsibility.\" He turned to ProfessorMcGonagall. \"I must go back to the feast, Minerva, I've got to giveout a few notices. Come, Severus, there's a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample -\"Snape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as he allowedhimself to be swept out of his office, leaving them alone with Professor McGonagall, who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle.\"You'd better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, you'rebleeding.\"\"Not much,\" said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his eye withhis sleeve. \"Professor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted -\"\"The Sorting Ceremony is over,\" said Professor McGonagall.\"Your sister is also in Gryffindor.\"\"Oh, good,\" said Ron.\"And speaking of Gryffindor -\" Professor McGonagall saidsharply, but Harry cut in: \"Professor, when we took the car, termhadn't started, so - so Gryffindor shouldn't really have pointstaken from it - should it?\" he finished, watching her anxiously.Professor McGonagall gave him a piercing look, but he was sureshe had almost smiled. Her mouth looked less thin, anyway.\"I will not take any points from Gryffindor,\" she said, andHarry's heart lightened considerably. \"But you will both get a detention.\"It was better than Harry had expected. As for Dumbledore'swriting to the Dursleys, that was nothing. Harry knew perfectlywell they'd just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn'tsquashed him flat.82Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape'sdesk. A large plate of sandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of-icedpumpkin juice appeared with a pop.\"You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory,\" shesaid. \"I must also return to the feast.\"71When the door had closed behind her, Ron let out a long, low whistle.\"I thought we'd had it,\" he said, grabbing a sandwich.\"So did I,\" said Harry, taking one, too.\"Can you believe our luck, though?\" said Ron thickly through amouthful of chicken and ham. \"Fred and George must've flown thatcar five or six times and no Muggle ever saw them.\" He swallowedand took another huge bite. \"Why couldn't we get through the barrier?\"Harry shrugged. \"We'll have to watch our step from now on, though,\"he said, taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice. \"Wish we could'vegone up to the feast ......\"She didn't want us showing off,\" said Ron sagely. \"Doesn't wantpeople to think it's clever, arriving by flying car.\"When they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could (the platekept refilling itself) they rose and left the office, treading the familiarpath to Gryffindor Tower. The castle was quiet; it seemed that thefeast was over. They walked past muttering portraits and creakingsuits of armor, and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs, until at lastthey reached the passage where the secret entrance to GryffindorTower was hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in apink silk dress.\"Password?\" she said as they approached.\"Er -\" said Harry.They didn't know the new year's password, not having met aGryffindor prefect yet, but help came almost immediately; they heardhurrying feet behind them and turned to see Hermione dashing towardthem.\"There you are! Where have you been? The most ridiculous rumors -someone said you'd been expelled for crashing a flying car\"Well, we haven't been expelled,\" Harry assured her.\"You're not telling me you did fly here?\" said Hermione, sounding72almost as severe as Professor McGonagall.\"Skip the lecture,\" said Ron impatiently, \"and tell us the newpassword.\"\"It's `wattlebird,\"' said Hermione impatiently, \"but that's not the point -\"Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat ladyswung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping. It looked asthough the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed intothe circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables andsquashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive. Arms reached throughthe portrait hole to pull Harry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione toscramble in after then-t.\"Brilliant!\" yelled Lee Jordan. \"Inspired! What an entrance! Flying acar right into the Whomping Willow, people'll be talking about thatone for years -\"\"Good for you,\" said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someonewas patting him on the back as though he'd just won a marathon;Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and saidtogether, \"Why couldn't we've come in the car, eh?\"84Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry couldsee one person who didn't look happy at all. Percy was visible overthe heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to be trying toget near enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged Ron in theribs and nodded in Percy's direction. Ron got the point at once.\"Got to get upstairs - bit tired,\" he said, and the two of them startedpushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room,which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories.\"'Night,\" Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowljust like Percy's.They managed to get to the other side of the common room, stillhaving their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase.73They hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door oftheir old dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS.They entered the familiar, circular room, with its five four-postershung with red velvet and its high, narrow windows. Their trunks hadbeen brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds.Ron grinned guiltily at Harry.\"I know I shouldn't've enjoyed that or anything, but ='The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second yearGryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and NevilleLongbottom.\"Unbelievable!\" beamed Seamus.\"Cool,\" said Dean.\"Amazing,\" said Neville, awestruck.Harry couldn't help it. He grinned, too.* 85 *H-H A P T E RR s 1 xGILDEROY LOCKHARThe next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things started to godownhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long house tableswere laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains oftoast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling(today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindortable next to Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampirespropped open against a milk jug. There was a slight stiffness in theway she said \"Morning,\" which told Harry that she was stilldisapproving of the way they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on theother hand, greeted them cheerfully. Neville was a round-faced andaccident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had evermet.\"Mail's due any minute - I think Gran's sending a few things I forgot.\"74Harry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there wasa rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls86streamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into thechattering crowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville's headand, a second later, something large and gray fell into Hermione's jug,spraying them all with milk and feathers.\"Enrol!\" said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. Errolslumped, unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp redenvelope in his beak.\"Oh, no -\" Ron gasped.\"It's all right, he's still alive,\" said Hermione, prodding Errol gently withthe tip of her finger.\"It's not that - it's that.\"Ron was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary toHarry, but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though theyexpected it to explode.\"What's the matter?\" said Harry.\"She's - she's sent me a Howler,\" said Ron faintly.\"You'd better open it, Ron,\" said Neville in a timid whisper. \"It'll beworse if you don't My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and\" -he gulped - \"it was horrible.\"Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope.\"What's a Howler?\" he said.But Ron's whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun tosmoke at the corners.75\"Open it,\" Neville urged. \"It'll all be over in a few minutes -\"Ron stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from Errol'sbeak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears. A splitsecond later, Harry knew why. He thought for a moment it hadexploded; a roar of sound fiIled the huge hall, shaking dust from theceiling.8 _PRISED IF THEY'D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GETWE SAW IT WAS GONE -\"Mrs. Weasleys yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made theplates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off thestone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to seewho had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair thatonly his crimson forehead could be seen.YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULDBOTH HAVE DIED -\"Harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up. Hetried very hard to look as though he couldn't hear the voice that wasmaking his eardrums throb.YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOUSTRAIGHT BACK HOME.\"A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron'shand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat76stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A fewpeople laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again.Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the topof Ron's head.* 88\"Well, I don't know what you expected, Ron, but you -\"\"Don't tell me I deserved it,\" snapped Ron.Harry pushed his porridge away. His insides were burning with guilt.Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work. After all Mr. and Mrs.Weasley had done for him over the summer ...But he had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall wasmoving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules.Harry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with theHufepuffs first.Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed thevegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magicalplants were kept. At least the Howler had done one good thing:Hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough andwas being perfectly friendly again.As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the classstanding outside, waiting for Professor Sprout. Harry, Ron, andHermione had only just joined them when she came striding into viewacross the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart. ProfessorSprout's arms were full of bandages, and with another twinge of guilt,Harry spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several of itsbranches now in slings.Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat overher flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on herclothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint.Gilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in sweeping robes ofturquoise, his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoisehat with gold trimming.77\"Oh, hello there!\" he called, beaming around at the assembled89students. \"Just been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctora Whomping Willow! But I don't want you running away with the ideathat I'm better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to have metseveral of these exotic plants on my travels . . .\"\"Greenhouse three today, chaps!\" said Professor Sprout, who waslooking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self.There was a murmur of interest. They had only ever worked ingreenhouse one before - greenhouse three housed far more interestingand dangerous plants. Professor Sprout took a large key from her beltand unlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp earth andfertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrellasizedflowers dangling from the ceiling. He was about to follow Ronand Hermione inside when Lockhart's hand shot out.\"Harry! I've been wanting a word - you don't mind if he's a couple ofminutes late, do you, Professor Sprout?\"Judging by Professor Sprout's scowl, she did mind, but Lockhart said,\"That's the ticket,\" and closed the greenhouse door in her face.\"Harry,\" said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlightas he shook his head. \"Harry, Harry, Harry.\"Completely nonplussed, Harry said nothing.\"When I heard -well, of course, it was all my fault. Could have kickedmyself.\"Harry had no idea what he was talking about. He was about to say sowhen Lockhart went on, \"Don't know when I've been more shocked.Flying a car to Hogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once why you'ddone it. Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry.\"It was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliantteeth even when he wasn't talking.7890\"Gave you a taste for publicity, didn't I?\" said Lockhart. \"Gaveyou the bug. You got onto the front page of the paper with me andyou couldn't wait to do it again.\"\"Oh, no, Professor, see -\"\"Harry, Harry, Harry,\" said Lockhart, reaching out and graspinghis shoulder. \"I understand. Natural to want a bit more once you'vehad that first taste - and I blame myself for giving you that, because it was bound to go to your head - but see here, young man,you can't start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed. Just calmdown, all right? Plenty of time for all that when you're older. Yes,yes, I know what you're thinking! 'It's all right for him, he's an internationally famous wizard already!' But when I was twelve, I wasjust as much of a nobody as you are now. In fact, Id say I was evenmore of a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven'tthey? All that business with He-\\\"o-Must-Not-Be-Named!\" Heglanced at the lightning scar on Harry's forehead. \"I know, Iknow - it's not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly's MostCharming-Smile Award five times in a row, as I have - but it's astart, Harry, it's a start.\"He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stoodstunned for a few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed tobe in the greenhouse, he opened the door and slid inside.Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored earmuffs were lying on the bench. When Harry had taken his placebetween Ron and Hermione, she said, \"We'll be repotting Mandrakes today. Now, who can tell me the properties of the Mandrake?\"To nobody's surprise, Hermione's hand was first into the air.s1\"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,\" said Hermione,sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook. \"It isused to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to theiroriginal state.\"\"Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,\" said Professor Sprout. \"TheMandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes. It is also,however, dangerous. Who can tell me why?\"79Hermione's hand narrowly missed Harry's glasses as it shot up again.\"The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,\" she saidpromptly.\"Precisely. Take another ten points,\" said Professor Sprout. \"Now, theMandrakes we have here are still very young.\"She pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyoneshuffled forward for a better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants,purplish green in color, were growing there in rows. They looked quiteunremarkable to Harry, who didn't have the slightest idea whatHermione meant by the \"cry\" of the Mandrake.\"Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,\" said Professor Sprout.There was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn'tpink and fluffy.\"When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completelycovered,\" said Professor Sprout. \"When it is safe to remove them, Iwill give you the thumbs-up. Right - earmuffs on.\"Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out soundcompletely. Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her ownears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plantsfirmly, and pulled hard.*92*Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped outof the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He hadpale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of hislungs.Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table andplunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost untilonly the tufted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off herhands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs.80\"As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won't kill yet,\" shesaid calmly as though she'd just done nothing more exciting than watera begonia. \"However, they will knock you out for several hours, and asI'm sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure yourearmuffs are securely in place while you work. I will attract yourattention when it is time to pack up.\"Four to a tray - there is a large supply of pots here - compost in thesacks over there - and be careful of the Venemous Tentacula, it'steething.\"She gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, makingit draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over hershoulder.Harry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly-hairedHufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to.\"Justin Finch-Fletchley,\" he said brightly, shaking Harry by the hand.\"Know who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter... And you'reHermione Granger - always top in everything\"* 9%(Hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too) \"- and RonWeasley. Wasn't that your flying car?\"Ron didn't smile. The Howler was obviously still on his mind.\"That Lockhart's something, isn't he?\" said Justin happily as theybegan fiIling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. \"Awfullybrave chap. Have you read his books? Id have died of fear if Id beencornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and -zap - just fantastic.\"My name was down for Eton, you know. I can't tell you how glad Iam I came here instead. Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed,but since I made her read Lockhart's books I think she's begun to seehow useful it'll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family . . . .\"After that they didn't have much chance to talk. Their earmuffs were81back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. ProfessorSprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn't. The Mandrakesdidn't like coming out of the earth, but didn't seem to want to go backinto it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, andgnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash aparticularly fat one into a pot.By the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty,aching, and covered in earth. Everyone traipsed back to the castle fora quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration.Professor McGonagall's classes were always hard work, but todaywas especially difficult. Everything Harry had learned last yearseemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer. He wassupposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed* 94to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over thedesktop avoiding his wand.Ron was having far worse problems. He had patched up his wandwith some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyondrepair. It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every timeRon tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smokethat smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what he was doing, Ronaccidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for anew one. Professor McGonagall wasn't pleased.Harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain felt like a wrungsponge. Everyone fiIed out of the classroom except him and Ron, whowas whacking his wand furiously on the desk.\"Stupid - useless - thing -\"\"Write home for another one,\" Harry suggested as the wand let off avolley of bangs like a firecracker.\"Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,\" said Ron, stuffing the nowhissing wand into his bag. \" `It's your own fault your wand got snapped -'\"82They went down to lunch, where Ron's mood was not improved byHermione's showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she hadproduced in Transfiguration.\"What've we got this afternoon?\" said Harry, hastily changing thesubject.\"Defense Against the Dark Arts,\" said Hermione at once.\"Why, \"demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, \"have you outlined allLockhart's lessons in little hearts?\"Hermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously.* 95 *They finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard.Hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyageswith Vampires again. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch forseveral minutes before Harry became aware that he was being closelywatched. Looking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he'dseen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as thoughtransfixed. He was clutching what looked like an ordinary Mugglecamera, and the moment Harry looked at him, he went bright red.\"All right, Harry? I'm -I'm Colin Creevey,\" he said breathlessly, takinga tentative step forward. \"I'm in Gryffindor, too. D'you think - would itbe all right if - can I have a picture?\" he said, raising the camerahopefully.\"A picture?\" Harry repeated blankly.\"So I can prove I've met you,\" said Colin Creevey eagerly, edgingfurther forward. \"I know all about you. Everyone's told me. Abouthow you survived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how hedisappeared and everything and how you've still got a lightning scar onyour forehead\" (his eyes raked Harry's hairline) \"and a boy in mydormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion, the pictures'llmove.\" Colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said,\"It's amazing here, isn't it? I never knew all the odd stuff I could dowas magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts. My dad's a milkman, hecouldn't believe it either. So I'm taking loads of pictures to send home83to him. And it'd be really good if I had one of you\" - he lookedimploringly at Harry - \"maybe your friend could take it and I couldstand next to you? And then, could you sign it?\"96\"Signed photos? You're giving out signed photos, Potter?\"Loud and scathing, Draco Malfoy's voice echoed around thecourtyard. He had stopped right behind Colin, flanked, as he alwayswas at Hogwarts, by his large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe andGoyle.\"Everyone line up!\" Malfoy roared to the crowd. \"Harry Potter'sgiving out signed photos!\"\"No, I'm not,\" said Harry angrily, his fists clenching. \"Shut up,Malfoy.\"\"You're just jealous,\" piped up Colin, whose entire body was aboutas thick as Crabbe's neck.`jealous?\"said Malfoy, who didn't need to shout anymore: half thecourtyard was listening in. \"Of what? I don't want a foul scar rightacross my head, thanks. I don't think getting your head cut openmakes you that special, myself.\"Crabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly.\"Eat slugs, Malfoy,\" said Ron angrily. Crabbe stopped laughing andstarted rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way.\"Be careful, Weasley,\" sneered Malfoy. \"You don't want to start anytrouble or your Mommy'll have to come and take you away fromschool.\" He put on a shrill, piercing voice. \"Ifyou put another toeout of line' - \"A knot of Slytherin fifth-years nearby laughed loudly at this.\"Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter,\" smirked Malfoy. \"It'dbe worth more than his family's whole house -\"84Ron whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione shut Voyageswith Vampires with a snap and whispered, \"Look out!\"\"What's all this, what's all this?\" Gilderoy Lockhart was striding* 97toward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him. \"Who's giving out signed photos?\"Harry started to speak but he was cut short as Lockhart flung anarm around his shoulders and thundered jovially, \"Shouldn't haveasked! We meet again, Harry!\"Pinned to Lockhart's side and burning with humiliation, Harrysaw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd.\"Come on then, Mr. Creevey,\" said Lockhart, beaming at Colin.\"A double portrait, can't do better than that, and we'll both sign itfor you.\"Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bellrang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes.\"Off you go, move along there,\" Lockhart called to the crowd,and he set off back to the castle with Harry, who was wishing heknew a good Vanishing Spell, still clasped to his side.\"A word to the wise, Harry,\" said Lockhart paternally as theyentered the building through a side door. \"I covered up for youback there with young Creevey - if he was photographing me,too, your schoolmates won't think you're setting yourself up somuch . . . .\"Deaf to Harry's stammers, Lockhart swept him down a corridorlined with staring students and up a staircase.\"Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage ofyour career isn't sensible - looks a tad bigheaded, Harry, to befrank. There may well come a time when, like me, you'll need tokeep a stack handy wherever you go, but\" - he gave a little chortle - \"I don't think you're quite there yet.\"They had reached Lockhart's classroom and he let Harry go at98last. Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the veryback of the class, where he busied himself with piling all seven ofLockhart's books in front of him, so that he could avoid looking at thereal thing.85The rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and Hermione satdown on either side of Harry.\"You could've fried an egg on your face\" said Ron. \"You'd better hopeCreevey doesn't meet Ginny, or they'll be starting a Harry Potter fanclub.\"\"Shut up,\" snapped Harry. The last thing he needed was for Lockhartto hear the phrase \"Harry Potter fan club.\"When the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared his throat loudlyand silence fell. He reached forward, picked up Neville Longbottom'scopy of Travels with Trolls, and held it up to show his own, winkingportrait on the front.\"Me,\" he said, pointing at it and winking as well. \"Gilderoy Lockhart,Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark ForceDefense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award - but I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid ofthe Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!\"He waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly.\"I see you've all bought a complete set of my books -well done. Ithought we'd start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry aboutjust to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in -\"When he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front ofthe class and said, \"You have thirty minutes - start - now!\"Harry looked down at his paper and read:1. What is Gilderoy Lockhart 's favorite color?2. What is Gilderoy Lockhart's secret ambition?3. What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatestachievement to date?86On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to:54. When is Gilderoy Lockhart's birthday, and what would hisideal gift be?Half an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and rifled throughthem in front of the class.\"Tut, tut - hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color islilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti. And a few of you need to readWanderings with Werewolves more carefully - I clearly state in chaptertwelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between allmagic and non-magic peoples - though I wouldn't say no to a largebottle of Ogdeds Old Firewhisky!\"He gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now staring atLockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face; SeamusFinnigan and Dean Thomas, who were sitting in front, were shakingwith silent laughter. Hermione, on the other hand, was listening toLockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned hername.\". . . but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid theworld of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions - goodgirl! In fact\" - he flipped her paper over - \"full marks! Where is MissHermione Granger?\"*100*Hermione raised a trembling hand.\"Excellent!\" beamed Lockhart. \"Quite excellent! Take ten points forGryffindor! And so - to business -\"He bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto it.\"Now - be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulestcreatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing yourworst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilstI am here. All I ask is that you remain calm.\"In spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of books for a better87look at the cage. Lockhart placed a hand on the cover. Dean andSeamus had stopped laughing now. Neville was cowering in his frontrow seat.\"I must ask you not to scream,\" said Lockhart in a low voice. \"It mightprovoke them.\"As the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped off the cover.\"Yes,\" he said dramatically. \"Freshly caught Cornish pixies. \"Seamus Finnigan couldn't control himself. He let out a snort oflaughter that even Lockhart couldn't mistake for a scream of terror.\"Yes?\" He smiled at Seamus.\"Well, they're not - they're not very - dangerous, are they?\" Seamuschoked.\"Don't be so sure!\" said Lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly atSeamus. \"Devilish tricky little blighters they can be!\"The pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointedfaces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgiesarguing. The moment the cover had been removed, they*101*had started jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars andmaking bizarre faces at the people nearest them.\"Right, then,\" Lockhart said loudly. \"Let's see what you make ofthem!\" And he opened the cage.It was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every direction like rockets.Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air.Several shot straight through the window, showering the back rowwith broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom moreeffectively than a rampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles andsprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore picturesfrom the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and booksand threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the88class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from theiron chandelier in the ceiling.\"Come on now - round them up, round them up, they're only pixies,\"Lockhart shouted.He rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed,\"Peskipiksi Pesternomi!\"It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand andthrew it out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under hisown desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell asecond later as the chandelier gave way.The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the relativecalm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry,Ron, and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, \"Well, I'llask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.\" Heswept past them and shut the door quickly behind him.*102*\"Can you believe him?\" roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bithim painfully on the ear.\"He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,\" said Hermione,immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm andstuffing them back into their cage.\"Hands on? \"said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out ofreach with its tongue out. \"Hermione, he didn't have a clue what hewas doing -\"\"Rubbish,\" said Hermione. \"You've read his books - look at all thoseamazing things he's done -\"\"He says he's done,\" Ron muttered.arry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sightwhenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder89to avoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry'sschedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, \"Allright, Harry?\" six or seven times a day and hear, \"Hello, Colin,\" back,however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it.Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car journeyand Ron's wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Fridaymorning by shooting out of Ron's hand in Charms and hitting tiny oldProfessor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large,throbbing green boil where it had struck. So with one thing andanother, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, andHermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry,however, was shaken awake several hours earlier*104*than he would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the GryffindorQuidditch team.\"Whassamatter?\" said Harry groggily.\"Quidditch practice!\" said Wood. \"Come on!\"Harry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging acrossthe pink-and-gold sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn'tunderstand how he could have slept through the racket the birds weremaking.\"Oliver,\" Harry croaked. \"It's the crack of dawn.\"\"Exactly,\" said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at themoment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. \"It's partof our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and let's go,\"said Wood heartily. \"None of the other teams have started training yet;we're going to be first off the mark this year -\"Yawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried tofind his Quidditch robes.\"Good man,\" said Wood. \"Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes.90When he'd found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak forwarmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he'd gone andwent down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus TwoThousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the portrait hole whenthere was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing downthe spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck andsomething clutched in his hand.\"I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry! Look whatI've got here! I've had it developed, I wanted to show you -\"*105*Harry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishingunder his nose.A moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard on an armHarry recognized as his own. He was pleased to see that hisphotographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to bedragged into view. As Harry watched, Lockhart gave up andslumped, panting, against the white edge of the picture.\"Will you sign it?\" said Colin eagerly.\"No,\" said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room wasreally deserted. \"Sorry, Colin, I'm in a hurry - Quidditch practice -\"He climbed through the portrait hole.\"Oh, wow! Wait for me! I've never watched a Quidditch gamebefore!\"Colin scrambled through the hole after him.\"It'll be really boring,\" Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored him, hisface shining with excitement.\"You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren'tyou, Harry? Weren't you?\" said Colin, trotting alongside him. \"Youmust be brilliant. I've never flown. Is it easy? Is that your ownbroom? Is that the best one there is?\"91Harry didn't know how to get rid of him. It was like having anextremely talkative shadow.\"I don't really understand Quidditch,\" said Colin breathlessly. \"Is ittrue there are four balls? And two of them fly around trying to knockpeople off their brooms?\"\"Yes,\" said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicatedrules of Quidditch. \"They're called Bludgers. There are two Beaters), *106*on each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from theirside. Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.\"\"And what are the other balls for?\" Colin asked, tripping down acouple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry.\"Well, the Quafe - that's the biggish red one - is the one that scoresgoals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each otherand try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch -they're three long poles with hoops on the end.\"\"And the fourth ball -\"\"- is the Golden Snitch,\" said Harry, \"and it's very small, very fast, anddifficult to catch. But that's what the Seeker's got to do, because agame of Quidditch doesn't end until the Snitch has been caught. Andwhichever team's Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extrahundred and fifty points.\"\"And you're the Gryffindor Seeker, aren't you?\" said Colin in awe.\"Yes,\" said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dewdrenchedgrass. \"And there's the Keeper, too. He guards the goalposts. That's it, really.\"But Colin didn't stop questioning Harry all the way down the slopinglawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when hereached the changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice,\"I'll go and get a good seat, Harry!\" and hurried off to the stands.92The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room.Wood was the only person who looked truly awake. Fred and GeorgeWeasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and touslehaired, next to fourth yearAlicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behindher. Her fellow Chasers, Katie*107*Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side oppositethem.\"There you are, Harry, what kept you?\" said Wood briskly. \"Now, Iwanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field,because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program,which I really think will make all the difference ....Wood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on whichwere drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in differentcolored inks.He took out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began towiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood launched into aspeech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley's head drooped rightonto Alicia Spinnet's shoulder and he began to snore.The first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there wasanother board under that, and a third under that one. Harry sank intoa stupor as Wood droned on and on.\"So,\" said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fantasyabout what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment upat the castle. \"Is that clear? Any questions?\"\"I've got a question, Oliver,\" said George, who had woken with astart. \"Why couldn't you have told us all this yesterday when wewere awake?\"Wood wasn't pleased.\"Now, listen here, you lot,\" he said, glowering at them all. \"Weshould have won the Quidditch cup last year. We're easily the bestteam. But unfortunately -owing to circumstances beyond our control -\"93*108*Harry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been unconscious in thehospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning thatGryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worstdefeat in three hundred years.Wood took a moment to regain control of himself. Their last defeatwas clearly still torturing him.\"So this year, we train harder than ever before .... Okay, let's go andput our new theories into practice!\" Wood shouted, seizing hisbroomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms. Stiffleggedand still yawning, his team followed.They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was upcompletely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in thestadium. As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermionesitting in the stands.\"Aren't you finished yet?\" called Ron incredulously.\"Haven't even started,\" said Harry, looking jealously at the toast andmarmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall.\"Wood's been teaching us new moves.\"He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up intothe air. The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far moreeffectively than Wood's long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on theQuidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed,racing Fred and George.\"What's that funny clicking noise?\" called Fred as they hurtled aroundthe corner.Harry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one of the highestseats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the soundstrangely magnified in the deserted stadium.*io9*94\"Look this way, Harry! This way!\" he cried shrilly.\"Who's that?\" said Fred.\"No idea,\" Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as faraway as possible from Colin.\"What's going on?\" said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed through theair toward them. \"Why's that first year taking pictures? I don't like it.He could be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new trainingprogram.\"\"He's in Gryffindor,\" said Harry quickly.\"And the Slytherins don't need a spy, Oliver,\" said George.\"What makes you say that?\" said Wood testily.\"Because they're here in person,\" said George, pointing.Several people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticksin their hands.\"I don't believe it!\" Wood hissed in outrage. \"I booked the field fortoday! We'll see about this!\"Wood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant toin his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted. Harry, Fred, andGeorge followed.\"Flint!\" Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. \"This is our practicetime! We got up specially! You can clear off now!\"Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a look of trollishcunning on his face as he replied, \"Plenty of room for all of us, Wood.\"Angelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were no girlson the Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing theGryffindors, leering to a man.\"But I booked the field!\" said Wood, positively spitting with rage. \"Ibooked it!\"95*110*\"Ah,\" said Flint. \"But I've got a specially signed note here fromProfessor Snape. `I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin teampermission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need totrain their new Seeker.\"'\"You've got a new Seeker?\" said Wood, distracted. \"Where?\"And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh,smaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face. It was DracoMalfoy.\"Aren't you Lucius Malfoy's son?\" said Fred, looking at Malfoy withdislike.\"Funny you should mention Draco's father,\" said Flint as the wholeSlytherin team smiled still more broadly. \"Let me show you thegenerous gift he's made to the Slytherin team.\"All seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven highly polished,brand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling thewords Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors'noses in the early morning sun.\"Very latest model. Only came out last month,\" said Flint carelessly,flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. \"I believe it outstripsthe old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the oldCleansweeps\" - he smiled nastily at Fred and George, who were bothclutching Cleansweep Fives - \"sweeps the board with them.\"None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for amoment. Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reducedto slits.\"Oh, look,\" said Flint. \"A field invasion.\"Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on.*111*96\"What's happening?\" Ron asked Harry. \"Why aren't you playing? Andwhat's he doing here?\"He was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes.\"I'm the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,\" said Malfoy, smugly.\"Everyone's just been admiring the brooms my father's bought ourteam.Ron gaped, open-mouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front ofhim.\"Good, aren't they?\" said Malfoy smoothly. \"But perhaps theGryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms,too. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museumwould bid for them.\"The Slytherin team howled with laughter.\"At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in,\" saidHermione sharply. \"They got in on pure talent.\"The smug look on Malfoy's face flickered.\"No one asked your opinion, you fiIthy little Mudblood,\" he spat.Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really badbecause there was an instant uproar at his words. Flint had to dive infront of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him, Aliciashrieked, \"How dare you!\" ; and Ron plunged his hand into his robes,pulled out his wand, yelling, \"You'll pay for that one, Malfoy!\" andpointed it furiously under Flint's arm at Malfoys face.A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shotout of the wrong end of Ron's wand, hitting him in the stomach andsending him reeling backward onto the grass.12\"Ron! Ron! Are you all right?\" squealed Hermione.Ron opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead he97gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouthonto his lap.The Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. Flint was doubledup, hanging onto his new broomstick for support. Malfoy was on allfours, banging the ground with his fist. The Gryffindors weregathered around Ron, who kept belching large, glistening slugs.Nobody seemed to want to touch him.\"We'd better get him to Hagrid's, it's nearest,\" said Harry toHermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron upby the arms.\"What happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill? But you cancure him, can't you?\" Colin had run down from his seat and was nowdancing alongside them as they left the field. Ron gave a huge heaveand more slugs dribbled down his front.\"Oooh,\" said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. \"Can you holdhim still, Harry?\"\"Get out of the way, Colin!\" said Harry angrily. He and Hermionesupported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds towardthe edge of the forest.\"Nearly there, Ron,\" said Hermione as the gamekeeper's cabin cameinto view. \"You'll be all right in a minute - almost there -\"They were within twenty feet of Hagrid's house when the front dooropened, but it wasn't Hagrid who emerged. Gilderoy Lockhart,wearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out.\"Quick, behind here,\" Harry hissed, dragging Ron behind a nearbybush. Hermione followed, somewhat reluctantly.*113* *\"It's a simple matter if you know what you're doing!\" Lockhart wassaying loudly to Hagrid. \"If you need help, you know where I am! I'lllet you have a copy of my book. I'm surprised you haven't already gotone - I'll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!\" And hestrode away toward the castle.98Harry waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then pulled Ron out ofthe bush and up to Hagrid's front door. They knocked urgently.Hagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expressionbrightened when he saw who it was.\"Bin wonderin' when you'd come ter see me - come in, come in -thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again -\"Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the oneroomedcabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a firecrackling merrily in the other. Hagrid didn't seem perturbed by Ron'sslug problem, which Harry hastily explained as he lowered Ron into achair.\"Better out than in,\" he said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin infront of him. \"Get 'em all up, Ron.\"\"I don't think there's anything to do except wait for it to stop,\" saidHermione anxiously, watching Ron bend over the basin. \"That's adifficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand -\"Hagrid was bustling around making them tea. His boarhound, Fang,was slobbering over Harry.\"What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?\" Harry asked, scratchingFang's ears.\"Givin' me advice on gettin' kelpies out of a well,\" growled*114*Hagrid, moving a half-plucked rooster off his scrubbed table andsetting down the teapot. \"Like I don' know. An' bangin' on aboutsome banshee he banished. If one word of it was true, I'll eat mykettle.\"It was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts' teacher, and Harrylooked at him in surprise. Hermione, however, said in a voicesomewhat higher than usual, \"I think you're being a bit unfair.Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for99the job -\"\"He was the on' man for the job,\" said Hagrid, offering them a Yplate of treacle fudge, while Ron coughed squelchily into his basin.\"An' I mean the on' one. Gettin' very difficult ter find anyone fer Ythe Dark Arts job. People aren't too keen ter take it on, see. They'restartin' ter think it's jinxed. No one's lasted long fer a while now. Sotell me,\" said Hagrid, jerking his head at Ron. \"Who was he tryin' tercurse?\"\"Malfoy called Hermione something - it must've been really bad,because everyone went wild.\"\"It was bad,\" said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop lookingpale and sweaty. \"Malfoy called her `Mudblood,' Hagrid -\"Ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made theirappearance. Hagrid looked outraged.\"He didn'!\" he growled at Hermione.\"He did,\" she said. \"But I don't know what it means. I could tell itwas really rude, of course -\"\"It's about the most insulting thing he could think of,\" gasped Ron,coming back up. \"Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who isMuggle-born - you know, non-magic parents. There are*115*some wizards - like Malfoy's family - who think they're better thaneveryone else because they're what people call pure-blood.\" Hegave a small burp, and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand. Hethrew it into the basin and continued, \"I mean, the rest of us know itdoesn't make any difference at all. Look at Neville Longbottom -he's pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right wayup.\"\"An' they haven't invented a spell our Hermione can' do,\" said Hagridproudly, making Hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta.100\"It's a disgusting thing to call someone,\" said Ron, wiping his sweatybrow with a shaking hand. \"Dirty blood, see. Common blood. It'sridiculous. Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If wehadn't married Muggles we'd've died out.\"He retched and ducked out of sight again.\"Well, I don' blame yeh fer tryin' ter curse him, Ron,\" said Hagridloudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin. \"Bu' maybe itwas a good thing yer wand backfired. 'Spect Lucius Malfoywould've come marchin' up ter school if yeh'd cursed his son. Leastyer not in trouble.\"Harry would have pointed out that trouble didn't come much worsethan having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but he couldn't; Hagrid'streacle fudge had cemented his jaws together.\"Harry,\" said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought.\"Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I've heard you've bin givin' out signedphotos. How come I haven't got one?\"Furious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart.\"I have not been giving out signed photos,\" he said hotly. \"IfLockhart's still spreading that around -\"*116*But then he saw that Hagrid was laughing.\"I'm on'y jokin',\" he said, patting Harry genially on the back andsending him face first into the table. \"I knew yeh hadn't really. I toldLockhart yeh didn' need teh. Yer more famous than him withouttryin'.\"\"Bet he didn't like that,\" said Harry, sitting up and rubbing his chin.\"Don' think he did,\" said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling. \"An' then I toldhim Id never read one o' his books an' he decided ter go. Treaclefudge, Ron?\" he added as Ron reappeared.101\"No thanks,\" said Ron weakly. \"Better not risk it.\"\"Come an' see what I've bin growin',\" said Hagrid as Harry andHermione finished the last of their tea.In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid's house were a dozen ofthe largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen. Each was the size of alarge boulder.\"Gettin' on well, aren't they?\" said Hagrid happily. \"Fer the Halloweenfeast ... should be big enough by then.\"\"What've you been feeding them?\" said Harry.Hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone.\"Well, I've bin givin' them - you know - a bit o' help -\"Harry noticed Hagrid's flowery pink umbrella leaning against the backwall of the cabin. Harry had had reason to believe before now thatthis umbrella was not all it looked; in fact, he had the strongimpression that Hagrid's old school wand was concealed inside it.Hagrid wasn't supposed to use magic. He had been expelled fromHogwarts in his third year, but Harry had never found out why -anymention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his*117*throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject waschanged.\"An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?\" said Hermione, halfwaybetween disapproval and amusement. \"Well, you've done a good job onthem.\"\"That's what yer little sister said,\" said Hagrid, nodding at Ron. \"Mether jus' yesterday.\" Hagrid looked sideways at Harry, his beardtwitching. \"Said she was jus' lookin' round the grounds, but I reckonshe was hopin' she might run inter someone else at my house.\" Hewinked at Harry. \"If yeh ask me, she wouldn' say no ter a signed -\"\"Oh, shut up,\" said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter and the ground102was sprayed with slugs.\"Watch it!\" Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his preciouspumpkins.It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treaclefudge since dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat. They saidgood-bye to Hagrid and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughingoccasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs.They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rangout, \"There you are, Potter - Weasley.\" Professor McGonagall waswalking toward them, looking stern. \"You will both do your detentionsthis evening.\"\"What're we doing, Professor?\" said Ron, nervously suppressing aburp.\"You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch,\"said Professor McGonagall. \"And no magic, Weasley - elbow grease.\"*118*Ron gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every studentin the school.\"And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fanmail,\" said Professor McGonagall.\"Oh n - Professor, can't I go and do the trophy room, too?\" said Harrydesperately.\"Certainly not,\" said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows.\"Professor Lockhart requested you particularly. Eight o'clock sharp,both of you.\"Harry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepestgloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-schoolrulessort of expression. Harry didn't enjoy his shepherd's pie asmuch as he'd thought. Both he and Ron felt they'd got the worse deal.\"Filch'll have me there all night,\" said Ron heavily. \"No magic! There103must be about a hundred cups in that room. I'm no good at Mugglecleaning.\"\"I'd swap anytime,\" said Harry hollowly. \"I've had loads of practicewith the Dursleys. Answering Lockhart's fan mail ... he'll be anightmare ......Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like notime, it was five minutes to eight, and Harry was dragging his feetalong the second-floor corridor to Lockhart's office. He gritted histeeth and knocked.The door flew open at once. Lockhart beamed down at him.\"Ah, here's the scalawag!\" he said. \"Come in, Harry, come in -\"Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles werecountless framed photographs of Lockhart. He had even signed a fewof them. Another large pile lay on his desk.\"You can address the envelopes!\" Lockhart told Harry, as thoughthis was a huge treat. \"This first one's to Gladys Gudgeon, bless her -huge fan of mine -\"The minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockhart's voice wash over him,occasionally saying, \"Mmm\" and \"Right\" and \"Yeah.\" Now and thenhe caught a phrase like, \"Fame's a fickle friend, Harry,\" or \"Celebrityis as celebrity does, remember that.\"The candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over themany moving faces of Lockhart watching him. Harry moved hisaching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing outVeronica Smethley's address. It must be nearly time to leave, Harrythought miserably, please let it be nearly time...And then he heard something - something quite apart from thespitting of the dying candles and Lockhart's prattle about his fans.It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice ofbreathtaking, ice-cold venom.104\"Come ... come to me.... Let me rip you.... Let me tear you .... Let me kill you . .. .\"Harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on VeronicaSmethley's street.\"What?\" he said loudly.\"I know!\" said Lockhart. \"Six solid months at the top of the bestsellerlist! Broke all records!\"\"No,\" said Harry frantically. \"That voice!\"\"Sorry?\" said Lockhart, looking puzzled. \"What voice?\"\"That - that voice that said - didn't you hear it?\"Lockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment.* 3-2o *\"What are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you're getting a litdedrowsy? Great Scott - look at the time! We've been here nearly fourhours! Id never have believed it - the time's flown, hasn't it?\"Harry didn't answer. He was straining his ears to hear the voice again,but there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him he mustn'texpect a treat like this every time he got detention. Feeling dazed,Harry left.It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty.Harry went straight up to the dormitory. Ron wasn't back yet. Harrypulled on his pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later, Ronarrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish intothe darkened room.\"My muscles have all seized up,\" he groaned, sinking on his bed.\"Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch cup before he wassatisfied. And then I had another slug attack all over a Special Awardfor Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off... How wasit with Lockhart?\"105Keeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, and Seamus,Harry told Ron exactly what he had heard.\"And Lockhart said he couldn't hear it?\" said Ron. Harry could seehim frowning in the moonlight. \"D'you think he was lying? But I don'tget it - even someone invisible would've had to open the door.\"\"I know,\" said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and staring at thecanopy above him. \"I don't get it either.\"* 12-1 *122October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle.Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds amongthe staff and students. Her Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it leftthe drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley,who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. Thesteam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her wholehead was on fire.Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days onend; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid'spumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver Wood's enthusiasm forregular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Harrywas to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days beforeHalloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin andsplattered with mud..123Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn't been a happy practice session.Fred and George, who had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen forthemselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. Theyreported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs,shooting through the air like missiles.As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebodywho looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghostof Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, mutteringunder his breath, \". . . don't fulfill their requirements . . . half an inch, if that .. .\"\"Hello, Nick,\" said Harry.106\"Hello, hello,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. Hewore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff,which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. Hewas pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark skyand torrential rain outside.\"You look troubled, young Potter,\" said Nick, folding a transparent letter ashe spoke and tucking it inside his doublet.\"So do you,\" said Harry.\"Ah,\" Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, \"a matter of noimportance. . . . It's not as though I really wanted to join. . . . Thought I'dapply, but apparently I 'don't fulfill requirements' -\"In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face.\"But you would think, wouldn't you,\" he erupted suddenly, pulling the letterback out of his pocket, \"that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with ablunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?\"124\"Oh - yes,\" said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree.\"I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean,and my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a greatdeal of pain and ridicule. However -\" Nearly Headless Nick shook his letteropen and read furiously: \"'We can only accept huntsmen whose heads haveparted company with their bodies. You will appreciate that it would beimpossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such asHorseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret,therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements.With very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore.'\"Fuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away.\"Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most peoplewould think that's good and beheaded, but oh, no, it's not enough for SirProperly Decapitated-Podmore.\"Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a farcalmer tone, \"So - what's bothering you? Anything I can do?\"\"No,\" said Harry. \"Not unless you know where we can get seven freeNimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly -\"The rest of Harry's sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewlingfrom somewhere near his ankles. He looked down and found himself gazinginto a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the skeletal gray catwho was used by the caretaker, Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy in hisendless battle against students.\"You'd better get out of here, Harry,\" said Nick quickly. \"Filch isn't in a107good mood - he's got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frogbrains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He's been cleaning all morning,and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place -\".125\"Right,\" said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Norris,but not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power thatseemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly througha tapestry to Harry's right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-breaker.There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nosewas unusually purple.\"Filth!\" he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as hepointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry's Quidditch robes.\"Mess and muck everywhere! I've had enough of it, I tell you! Follow me,Potter!\"So Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followedFilch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on thefloor.Harry had never been inside Filch's office before; it was a place moststudents avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oillamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered aboutthe place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their labels,Harry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had everpunished. Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves. Ahighly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behindFilch's desk. It was common knowledge that he was always beggingDumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling.Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling aroundlooking for parchment.\"Dung,\" he muttered furiously, \"great sizzling dragon bogies . . . frog brains. . . rat intestines . . . I've had enough of it . . . make an example . . . where'sthe form . . . yes . . .\".126He retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched itout in front of him, dipping his long black quill into the ink pot.\"Name . . . Harry Potter. Crime . . .\"\"It was only a bit of mud!\" said Harry.\"It's only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it's an extra hour scrubbing!\"shouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose.\"Crime . . . befouling the castle . . . suggested sentence . . .\"Dabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry who108waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall.But as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling ofthe office, which made the oil lamp rattle.\"PEEVES!\" Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage. \"I'llhave you this time, I'll have you!\"And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from theoffice, Mrs. Norris streaking alongside him.Peeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived tocause havoc and distress. Harry didn't much like Peeves, but couldn't helpfeeling grateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves had done (and itsounded as though he'd wrecked something very big this time) woulddistract Filch from Harry.Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry sankinto a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one thing on it apartfrom his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silverlettering on the front. With a quick glance at the door to check that Filchwasn't on his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read: kwikspell ACorrespondence Course in Beginners' Magic.127Intrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf ofparchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front page said: Feel outof step in the world of modern magic? Find yourself making excuses not toperform simple spells? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork? Thereis an answer! Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learncourse. Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspellmethod! Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes: \"I had no memory forincantations and my potions were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspellcourse, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe ofmy Scintillation Solution!\" Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says: \"My wifeused to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulousKwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak! Thank you,Kwikspell!\"Fascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope's contents. Whyon earth did Filch want a Kwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn't aproper wizard? Harry was just reading \"Lesson One: Holding Your Wand(Some Useful Tips)\" when shuffling footsteps outside told him Filch wascoming back. Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw itback onto the desk just as the door opened.Filch was looking triumphant.\"That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!\" he was saying gleefully toMrs. Norris. \"We'll have Peeves out this time, my sweet -\"109His eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which,Harry realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started.Filch's pasty face went brick red. Harry braced himself for a tidal wave offury. Filch hobbled across to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw itinto a drawer.\"Have you - did you read -?\" he sputtered..128\"No,\" Harry lied quickly.Filch's knobbly hands were twisting together.\"If I thought you'd read my private - not that it's mine - for a friend - be thatas it may - however -\"Harry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder. His eyeswere popping, a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartanscarf didn't help.\"Very well - go - and don't breathe a word - not that - however, if you didn'tread - go now, I have to write up Peeves' report - go -\"Amazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, and backupstairs. To escape from Filch's office without punishment was probablysome kind of school record.\"Harry! Harry! Did it work?\"Nearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom. Behind him, Harrycould see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared tohave been dropped from a great height.\"I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch's office,\" said Nick eagerly.\"Thought it might distract him -\"\"Was that you?\" said Harry gratefully. \"Yeah, it worked, I didn't even getdetention. Thanks, Nick!\"They set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless Nick, Harry noticed,was still holding Sir Patrick's rejection letter..129\"I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt,\"Harry said.Nearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked right throughhim. He wished he hadn't; it was like stepping through an icy shower.\"But there is something you could do for me,\" said Nick excitedly. \"Harry -would I be asking too much - but no, you wouldn't want -\"\"What is it?\" said Harry.\"Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday,\" said NearlyHeadless Nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified.\"Oh,\" said Harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this.110\"Right.\"\"I'm holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will becoming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you wouldattend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome, too, ofcourse - but I daresay you'd rather go to the school feast?\" He watched Harryon tenterhooks.\"No,\" said Harry quickly, \"I'll come -\"\"My dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party! And\" - he hesitated,looking excited - \"do you think you could possibly mention to Sir Patrickhow very frightening and impressive you find me?\"\"Of - of course,\" said Harry.Nearly Headless Nick beamed at him. \"A deathday party?\" said Hermionekeenly when Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in thecommon room. \"I bet there aren't many living people who can say they'vebeen to one of those - it'll be fascinating!\".130\"Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?\" said Ron, whowas halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy. \"Sounds deaddepressing to me. . . .\"Rain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but insideall looked bright and cheerful. The firelight glowed over the countlesssquashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, inthe case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happenif you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had \"rescued\" thebrilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures classand it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot ofcurious people.Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and theKwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air,emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. Thesight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectaculardisplay of tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth, and itsescape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and theKwikspell envelope from Harry's mind. By the time Halloween arrived,Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest ofthe school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall hadbeen decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid's vast pumpkins had beencarved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there wererumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for theentertainment.\"A promise is a promise,\" Hermione reminded Harry bossily. \"You said111you'd go to the deathday party.\"So at seven o'clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past thedoorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with goldplates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons..131The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick's party had been linedwith candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long,thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly lighteven over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every stepthey took. As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, heheard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormousblackboard.\"Is that supposed to be music?\" Ron whispered. They turned a corner andsaw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvetdrapes.\"My dear friends,\" he said mournfully. \"Welcome, welcome . . . so pleasedyou could come. . . .\"He swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside.It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white,translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor,waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played byan orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overheadblazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rosein a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer.\"Shall we have a look around?\" Harry suggested, wanting to warm up hisfeet.\"Careful not to walk through anyone,\" said Ron nervously, and they set offaround the edge of the dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, aragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost,who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harrywasn't surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytheringhost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by theother ghosts..132\"Oh, no,\" said Hermione, stopping abruptly. \"Turn back, turn back, I don'twant to talk to Moaning Myrtle -\"\"Who?\" said Harry as they backtracked quickly.\"She haunts one of the toilets in the girls' bathroom on the first floor,\" saidHermione.\"She haunts a toilet?\"112\"Yes. It's been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums andflooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it's awfultrying to have a pee with her wailing at you -\"\"Look, food!\" said Ron.On the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in blackvelvet. They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in theirtracks, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, rotten fish were laidon handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped onsalvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furrygreen mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of atombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpingtondied 31st October, 1492Harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouchedlow, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed throughone of the stinking salmon.\"Can you taste it if you walk though it?\" Harry asked him.\"Almost,\" said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away..133\"I expect they've let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,\" said Hermioneknowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putridhaggis.\"Can we move? I feel sick,\" said Ron.They had barely turned around, however, when a little man swoopedsuddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them.\"Hello, Peeves,\" said Harry cautiously.Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverseof pale and transparent. He was wearing a bright orange party hat, arevolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face.\"Nibbles?\" he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered infungus.\"No thanks,\" said Hermione.\"Heard you talking about poor Myrtle,\" said Peeves, his eyes dancing.\"Rude you was about poor Myrtle.\" He took a deep breath and bellowed,\"OY! MYRTLE!\"\"Oh, no, Peeves, don't tell her what I said, she'll be really upset,\" Hermionewhispered frantically. \"I didn't mean it, I don't mind her - er, hello, Myrtle.\"The squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the glummest face Harryhad ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles.\"What?\" she said sulkily.\"How are you, Myrtle?\" said Hermione in a falsely bright voice. \"It's nice to113see you out of the toilet.\".134Myrtle sniffed.\"Miss Granger was just talking about you -\" said Peeves slyly in Myrtle'sear.\"Just saying - saying - how nice you look tonight,\" said Hermione, glaringat Peeves.Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously.\"You're making fun of me,\" she said, silver tears welling rapidly in hersmall, see-through eyes.\"No - honestly - didn't I just say how nice Myrtle's looking?\" saidHermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs.\"Oh, yeah -\"\"She did -\"\"Don't lie to me,\" Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding down her face, whilePeeves chuckled happily over her shoulder. \"D'you think I don't know whatpeople call me behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle! Miserable,moaning, moping Myrtle!\"\"You've forgotten pimply,\" Peeves hissed in her ear.Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon.Peeves shot after her, pelting her with moldy peanuts, yelling, \"Pimply!Pimply!\"\"Oh, dear,\" said Hermione sadly.Nearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the crowd..135\"Enjoying yourselves?\"\"Oh, yes,\" they lied.\"Not a bad turnout,\" said Nearly Headless Nick proudly. \"The WailingWidow came all the way up from Kent. . . . It's nearly time for my speech,I'd better go and warn the orchestra. . . .\"The orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment. They, andeveryone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as ahunting horn sounded.\"Oh, here we go,\" said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly.Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by aheadless horseman. The assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too,but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick's face.The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearingand plunging. At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held hisbearded head under his arm, from which position he was blowing the horn.114The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over thecrowd (everyone laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick,squashing his head back onto his neck.\"Nick!\" he roared. \"How are you? Head still hanging in there?\"He gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder.\"Welcome, Patrick,\" said Nick stiffly.\"Live 'uns!\" said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and givinga huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowdhowled with laughter)..136\"Very amusing,\" said Nearly Headless Nick darkly.\"Don't mind Nick!\" shouted Sir Patrick's head from the floor. \"Still upset wewon't let him join the Hunt! But I mean to say - look at the fellow -\"\"I think,\" said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, \"Nick's very- frightening and - er -\"\"Ha!\" yelled Sir Patrick's head. \"Bet he asked you to say that!\"\"If I could have everyone's attention, it's time for my speech!\" said NearlyHeadless Nick loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into an icyblue spotlight.\"My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow . . .\"But nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunthad just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning towatch. Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his audience, but gaveup as Sir Patrick's head went sailing past him to loud cheers.Harry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry.\"I can't stand much more of this,\" Ron muttered, his teeth chattering, as theorchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dancefloor.\"Let's go,\" Harry agreed.They backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who lookedat them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full ofblack candles.\"Pudding might not be finished yet,\" said Ron hopefully, leading the waytoward the steps to the entrance hall..137And then Harry heard it.\". . . rip . . . tear . . . kill . . .\"It was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had heard inLockhart's office.He stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his115might, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway.\"Harry, what're you -?\"\"It's that voice again - shut up a minute -\"\". . . soo hungry . . . for so long . . .\"\"Listen!\" said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione froze, watching him.\". . . kill . . . time to kill . . .\"The voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was moving away -moving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he staredat the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a phantom, towhom stone ceilings didn't matter?\"This way,\" he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrancehall. It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from theHalloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. Harry sprinted up themarble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him.\"Harry, what're we -\"\"SHH!\".138Harry strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainterstill, he heard the voice: \". . . I smell blood. . . . I SMELL BLOOD!\"His stomach lurched -\"It's going to kill someone!\" he shouted, and ignoring Ron's and Hermione'sbewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying tolisten over his own pounding footsteps -Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermionepanting behind him, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last,deserted passage.\"Harry, what was that all about?\" said Ron, wiping sweat off his face. \"Icouldn't hear anything. . . .\"But Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor.\"Look!\"Something was shining on the wall ahead. They approached slowly,squinting through the darkness. Foot-high words had been daubed on thewall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flamingtorches. the chamber of secrets has been opened. enemies of the heir,beware.\"What's that thing - hanging underneath?\" said Ron, a slight quiver in hisvoice.As they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped - there was a large puddle ofwater on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him, and they inched towardthe message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All three of themrealized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash..Mrs. Norris,116the caretaker's cat, was hanging by her tail from the torchbracket. She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring.For a few seconds, they didn't move. Then Ron said, \"Let's get out of here.\"\"Shouldn't we try and help -\" Harry began awkwardly.\"Trust me,\" said Ron. \"We don't want to be found here.\"But it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them thatthe feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where they stoodcame the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happytalk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into thepassage from both ends.The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spottedthe hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of thecorridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to seethe grisly sight.Then someone shouted through the quiet.\"Enemies of the Heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!\"It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyesalive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of thehanging, immobile cat.ON THE WALLWhat's going on here? What's going on?\" Attracted no doubt byMalfoy's shout, Argus Filch came shouldering his way through thecrowd. Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell back, clutching his face inhorror.\"My cat! My cat! What's happened to Mrs. Norris?\" he shrieked.And his popping eyes fell on Harry.\"You!\"he screeched. \"You! You've murdered my cat! You'vekilled her! I'll kill you! I'll -\"\"Argus!\"Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other117teachers. In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, and Hermioneand detached Mrs. Norris from the torch bracket.\"Come with me, Argus,\" he said to Filch. \"You, too, Mr. Potter, Mr.Weasley, Miss Granger.\"Lockhart stepped forward eagerly.*140*\"My office is nearest, Headmaster - just upstairs - please feel free -\"\"Thank you, Gilderoy,\" said Dumbledore.The silent crowd parted to let them pass. Lockhart, looking excited andimportant, hurried after Dumbledore; so did Professors McGonagalland Snape.As they entered Lockhart's darkened office there was a flurry ofmovement across the walls; Harry saw several of the Lockharts in thepictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers. The real Lockhart litthe candles on his desk and stood back. Dumbledore lay Mrs. Norrison the polished surface and began to examine her. Harry, Ron, andHermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the poolof candlelight, watching.The tip of Dumbledore's long, crooked nose was barely an inch fromMrs. Norris's fur. He was looking at her closely through his half-moonspectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking. ProfessorMcGonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes narrowed. Snapeloomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiarexpression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile. AndLockhart was hovering around all of them, making suggestions.\"It was definitely a curse that killed her - probably the TransmogrifianTorture - I've seen it used many times, so unlucky I wasn't there, Iknow the very countercurse that would have saved her . .....Lockhart's comments were punctuated by Filch's dry, racking sobs.He was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris,118his face in his hands. Much as he detested Filch, Harry*141*couldn't help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry ashe felt for himself If Dumbledore believed Filch, he would be expelledfor sure.Dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath andtapping Mrs. Norris with his wand but nothing happened: Shecontinued to look as though she had been recently stuffed.\". . . I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou,\"said Lockhart, \"a series of attacks, the full story's in myautobiography, I was able to provide the townsfolk with variousamulets, which cleared the matter up at once ......The photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding inagreement as he talked. One of them had forgotten to remove his hairnet.At last Dumbledore straightened up.\"She's not dead, Argus,\" he said softly.Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number ofmurders he had prevented.\"Not dead?\" choked Filch, looking through his fingers at Mrs. Norris.\"But why's she all - all stiff and frozen?\"\"She has been Petrified,\" said Dumbledore (\"Ah! I thought so!\" saidLockhart). \"But how, I cannot say . . . .\"\"Ask him!\" shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and tearstained face toHarry.\"No second year could have done this,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"itwould take Dark Magic of the most advanced -\"\"He did it, he did it!\" Filch spat, his pouchy face purpling. \"You sawwhat he wrote on the wall! He found - in my office - he knows I'm a -119I'm a -\" Filch's face worked horribly. \"He knows I'm a Squib!\" hefinished.142\"I never touched Mrs. Norris!\" Harry said loudly, uncomfortablyaware of everyone looking at him, including all the Lockharts on thewalls. \"And I don't even know what a Squib is.\"\"Rubbish!\" snarled Filch. \"He saw my Kwikspell letter!\"\"If I might speak, Headmaster,\" said Snape from the shadows, andHarry's sense of forboding increased; he was sure nothing Snape hadto say was going to do him any good.\"Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at thewrong time,\" he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though hedoubted it. \"But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here.Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn't he at theHalloween feast?\"Harry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about thedeathday party. \". . . there were hundreds of ghosts, theyll tell you we werethere -\"\"But why not join the feast afterward?\" said Snape, his black eyesglittering in the candlelight. \"Why go up to that corridor?\"Ron and Hermione looked at Harry.\"Because - because -\" Harry said, his heart thumping very fast;something told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them hehad been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear,\"because we were tired and wanted to go to bed,\" he said.\"Without any supper?\" said Snape, a triumphant smile flickering acrosshis gaunt face. \"I didn't think ghosts provided food fit for living peopleat their parties.\"\"We weren't hungry,\" said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a hugerumble.120Snape's nasty smile widened.*143*\"I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful,\" hesaid. \"It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privilegesuntil he is ready to tell us the whole story. I personally feel he shouldbe taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to behonest.\"\"Really, Severus,\" said Professor McGonagall sharply, \"I see noreason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn't hit over thehead with a broomstick. There is no evidence at all that Potter hasdone anything wrong.\"Dumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. His twinkling lightbluegaze made Harry feel as though he were being X-rayed.\"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus,\" he said firmly.Snape looked furious. So did Filch.\"My cat has been Petrified!\" he shrieked, his eyes popping. \"I want tosee some punishment!\"\"We will be able to cure her, Argus,\" said Dumbledore patiently.\"Professer Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. Assoon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made thatwill revive Mrs. Norris.\"\"I'll make it,\" Lockhart butted in. \"I must have done it a hundred times.I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep -\"\"Excuse me,\" said Snape icily. \"But I believe I am the Potions masterat this school.\"There was a very awkward pause.\"You may go,\" Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.They went, as quickly as they could without actually running. Whenthey were a floor up from Lockhart's office, they turned into121*144*an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them. Harrysquinted at his friends' darkened faces.\"D'you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?\"\"No,\" said Ron, without hesitation. \"Hearing voices no one else canhear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.\"Something in Ron's voice made Harry ask, \"You do believe me, don'tyou?\"\"'Course I do,\" said Ron quickly. \"But -you must admit it's weird ......\"I know it's weird,\" said Harry. \"The whole thing's weird. What wasthat writing on the wall about? The Cbamber Has Been Opened...What's that supposed to mean?\"\"You know, it rings a sort of bell,\" said Ron slowly. \"I think someonetold me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once ... might'vebeen Bill . . . .\"\"And what on earth's a Squib?\" said Harry.To his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger.\"Well - it's not funny really - but as it's Filch, he said. \"A Squib issomeone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn't got anymagic powers. Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, butSquibs are quite unusual. If Filch's trying to learn magic from aKwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib. It would explain a lot.Like why he hates students so much.\" Ron gave a satisfied smile.\"He's bitter.\"A clock chimed somewhere.\"Midnight,\" said Harry. \"We'd better get to bed before Snape comesalong and tries to frame us for something else.\"*145*122For a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack onMrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in everyone's minds by pacing the spotwhere she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker mightcome back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wallwith Mrs. Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to noeffect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. WhenFilch wasn't guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking redeyedthrough the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students andtrying to put them in detention for things like \"breathing loudly' and\"looking happy.\"Ginny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris's fate.According to Ron, she was a great cat lover.\"But you haven't really got to know Mrs. Norris,\" Ron told herbracingly. \"Honestly, we're much better off without her.\" Ginny's liptrembled. \"Stuff like this doesn't often happen at Hogwarts,\" Ronassured her. \"They'll catch the maniac who did it and have him out ofhere in no time. I just hope he's got time to Petrify Filch before he'sexpelled. I'm only joking -\" Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched.The attack had also had an effect on Hermione. It was quite usual forHermione to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now doingalmost nothing else. Nor could Harry and Ron get much responsefrom her when they asked what she was up to, and not until thefollowing Wednesday did they find out.Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him staybehind to scrape tubeworms off the desks. After a hurried lunch, hewent upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch-Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming*146*toward him. Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justincaught sight of him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the oppositedirection.Harry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of123Magic homework. Professor Binns had asked for a threefoot-longcomposition on \"The Medieval Assembly of EuropeanWizards.\"\"I don't believe it, I'm still eight inches short said Ron furiously, letting go of his parchment, which sprang back into a roll.\"And Hermione's done four feet seven inches and her writing'stiny. \"\"Where is she?\" asked Harry, grabbing the tape measure and unrollinghis own homework.\"Somewhere over there,\" said Ron, pointing along the shelves. \"Lookingfor another book. I think she's trying to read the whole library beforeChristmas.\"Harry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running away from him.\"Dunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an idiot,\" said Ron,scribbling away, making his writing as large as possible. \"All that junkabout Lockhart being so great -\"Hermione emerged from between the bookshelves. She looked irritableand at last seemed ready to talk to them.\"All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out,\" she said,sitting down next to Harry and Ron. \"And there's a two-week waitinglist. I wish I hadn't left my copy at home, but I couldn't fit it in my trunkwith all the Lockhart books.\"\"Why do you want it?\" said Harry.*141*\"The same reason everyone else wants it,\" said Hermione, \"to readup on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.\"\"What's that?\" said Harry quickly.\"That's just it. I can't remember,\" said Hermione, biting her lip. \"AndI can't find the story anywhere else -\"124\"Hermione, let me read your composition,\" said Ron desperately,checking his watch.\"No, I won't,\" said Hermione, suddenly severe. \"You've had tendays to finish it -\"\"I only need another two inches, come on -\"The bell rang. Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic,bickering.History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule. ProfessorBinns, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the mostexciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering theroom through the blackboard. Ancient and shriveled, many peoplesaid he hadn't noticed he was dead. He had simply got up to teachone day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of thestaff room fire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since.Today was as boring as ever. Professor Binns opened his notes andbegan to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearlyeveryone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming tolong enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again.He had been speaking for half an hour when something happenedthat had never happened before. Hermione put up her hand.Professor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lec*148*ture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed.\"Miss - er -?\"\"Granger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell us anythingabout the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Hermione in a clear voice.Dean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open,gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown'shead came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom's elbow slippedoff his desk.125Professor Binns blinked.\"My subject is History of Magic,\" he said in his dry, wheezy voice. \"Ideal with facts, Miss Granger, not myths and legends.\" He cleared histhroat with a small noise like chalk s!-ping and continued, \"InSeptember of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers\"He stuttered to a halt. Hermione's hand was waving in the air again.\"Miss Grant?\"\"Please, sir, don't legends always have a basis in fact?\"Professor Binns was looking at her in such amazement, Harry wassure no student had ever interrupted him before, alive or dead.\"Well,\" said Professor Binns slowly, \"yes, one could argue that, Isuppose.\" He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen astudent properly before. \"However, the legend of which you speak issuch a very sensational, even ludicrous tale -\"But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns's everyword. He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Harry*149*could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show ofinterest.\"Oh, very well,\" he said slowly. \"Let me see ... the Chamber ofSecrets ...\"You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousandyears ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witchesand wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named afterthem: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, andSalazar Slytherin. They built this castle together, far from pryingMuggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by commonpeople, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution.\"126He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued.\"For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seekingout youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to thecastle to be educated. But then disagreements sprang up betweenthem. A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherinwished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. Hebelieved that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families.He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to beuntrustworthy. After a while, there was a serious argument on thesubject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left theschool.\"Professor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkledold tortoise.\"Reliable historical sources tell us this much,\" he said. \"But thesehonest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of theChamber of Secrets. The story goes that Slytherin had built a*150*hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knewnothing.\"Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secretsso that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived atthe school. The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber ofSecrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school ofall who were unworthy to study magic.\"There was silence as he finished telling the story, but it wasn't theusual, sleepy silence that filled Professor Binns's classes. There wasunease in the air as everyone continued to watch him, hoping formore. Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed.\"The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course,\" he said. \"Naturally,the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, manytimes, by the most learned witches and wizards. It does not exist. Atale told to frighten the gullible.\"127Hermione's hand was back in the air.\"Sir - what exactly do you mean by the `horror within' theChamber?\"\"That is believed to be some sort of monster, which the Heir ofSlytherin alone can control,\" said Professor Binns in his dry, reedyvoice.The class exchanged nervous looks.\"I tell you, the thing does not exist,\" said Professor Binns, shuffling hisnotes. \"There is no Chamber and no monster.\"\"But, sir,\" said Seamus Finnigan, \"if the Chamber can only be openedby Slytherin's true heir, no one else would be able to find it, wouldthey?\"\"Nonsense, O'Flaherty,\" said Professor Binns in an aggravated*151*tone. \"If a long succession of Hogwarts headmasters andheadmistresses haven't found the thing -\"\"But, Professor,\" piped up Parvati Patil, \"you'd probably have to useDark Magic to open it -\"\"Just because a wizard doesn't use Dark Magic doesn't mean hecan't, Miss Pennyfeather,\" snapped Professor Binns. \"I repeat, if thelikes of Dumbledore -\"\"But maybe you've got to be related to Slytherin, so Dumbledorecouldn't -\" began Dean Thomas, but Professor Binns had hadenough.\"That will do,\" he said sharply. \"It is a myth! It does not exist! Thereis not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as asecret broom cupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story! Wewill return, if you please, to history, to solid, believable, verifiablefact!\"128And within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor.\"I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,\" Ron toldHarry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teemingcorridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags beforedinner. \"But I never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. Iwouldn't be in his house if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hathad tried to put me in Slytherin, I'd've got the train straight backhome ......Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn't say anything. Hisstomach had just dropped unpleasantly.Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat*152*had seriously considered putting him in Slytherin. He could remember,as though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his earwhen he'd placed the hat on his head a year before: You could be great,you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin would help you on theway to greatness, no doubt about that...But Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House's reputation for turning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, NotSlytherin! and the hat had said, Oh, well, if you're sure ... better beGryffindor...As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevy went past.\"Hiya, Harry!\"\"Hullo, Colin,\" said Harry automatically.\"Harry - Harry - a boy in my class has been saying you'reBut Colin was so small he couldn~t fight against the tide of peoplebearing him toward the Great Hall; they heard him squeak, \"See you,Harry!\" and he was gone.\"What's a boy in his class saying about you?\" Hermione wondered.129\"That I'm Slytherin's heir, I expect,\" said Harry, his stomach droppinganother inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch-Fletchley had run away from him at lunchtime.\"People here'll believe anything,\" said Ron in disgust.The crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircasewithout difficulty.\"D'you really think there's a Chamber of Secrets?\" Ron askedHermione.\"I don't know,\" she said, frowning. \"Dumbledore couldn't cure* 1,5 % *Mrs. Norris, and that makes me think that whatever attacked hermight not be - well - human.\"As she spoke, they turned a corner and found themselves at the endof the very corridor where the attack had happened. They stoppedand looked. The scene was just as it had been that night, except thatthere was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, and an emptychair stood against the wall bearing the message \"The Chamber ofSecrets has been Opened.\"\"That's where Filch has been keeping guard,\" Ron muttered.They looked at each other. The corridor was deserted.\"Can't hurt to have a poke around,\" said Harry, dropping his bag andgetting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along, searchingfor clues.\"Scorch marks!\" he said. \"Here - and here -\"\"Come and look at this!\" said Hermione. \"This is funny . . . .\"Harry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on thewall. Hermione was pointing at the topmost pane, where aroundtwenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a130small crack. A long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope, as thoughthey had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside.\"Have you ever seen spiders act like that?\" said Hermionewonderingly.\"No,\" said Harry, \"have you, Ron? Ron?\"He looked over his shoulder. Ron was standing well back and seemedto be fighting the impulse to run.\"What's up?\" said Harry.\"I - don't - like - spiders,\" said Ron tensely.\"I never knew that,\" said Hermione, looking at Ron in surprise.\"You've used spiders in Potions loads of times ......*154*\"I don't mind them dead,\" said Ron, who was carefully lookinganywhere but at the window. \"I just don't like the way they move ....Hermione giggled.\"It's not funny,\" said Ron, fiercely. \"If you must know, when I wasthree, Fred turned my - my teddy bear into a great big fiIthy spiderbecause I broke his toy broomstick .... You wouldn't like them either ifyou'd been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and. .. \"He broke off, shuddering. Hermione was obviously still trying not tolaugh. Feeling they had better get off the subject, Harry said,\"Remember all that water on the floor? Where did that come from?Someone's mopped it up.\"\"It was about here,\" said Ron, recovering himself to walk a few pacespast Filch's chair and pointing. \"Level with this door.\"He reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand asthough he'd been burned.131\"What's the matter?\" said Harry.\"Can't go in there,\" said Ron gruffly. \"That's a girls' toilet.\"\"Oh, Ron, there won't be anyone in there,\" said Hermione, standing upand coming over. \"That's Moaning Myrtle's place. Come on, let's havea look.\"And ignoring the large OUT of ORDER sign, she opened the door.It was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry had ever setfoot in. Under a large, cracked, and spotted mirror were a row ofchipped sinks. The floor was damp and reflected the dull light givenoff by the stubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders; thewooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one ofthem was dangling off its hinges.* -L 5,5Hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall.When she reached it she said, \"Hello, Myrtle, how are you?\"Harry and Ron went to look. Moaning Myrtle was floating above thetank of the toilet, picking a spot on her chin.\"This is a girls' bathroom,\" she said, eyeing Ron and Harry suspiciously.\"They're not girls.\"\"No,\" Hermione agreed. \"I just wanted to show them how er - nice it isin here.\"She waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor.\"Ask her if she saw anything,\" Harry mouthed at Hermione.\"What are you whispering?\" said Myrtle, staring at him.\"Nothing,\" said Harry quickly. \"We wanted to ask -\"\"I wish people would stop talking behind my back!\" said Myrtle, in avoice choked with tears. \"I do have feelings, you know, even if I amdead -\"132\"Myrtle, no one wants to upset you,\" said Hermione. \"Harry only -\"\"No one wants to upset me! That's a good one!\" howled Myrtle. \"Mylife was nothing but misery at this place and now people come alongruining my death!\"\"We wanted to ask you if you've seen anything funny lately,\" saidHermione quickly. \"Because a cat was attacked right outside yourfront door on Halloween.\"\"Did you see anyone near here that night?\" said Harry.\"I wasn't paying attention,\" said Myrtle dramatically. \"Peeves upset meso much I came in here and tried to kill myself Then, of course, Iremembered that I'm - that I'm \"\"Already dead,\" said Ron helpfully.* IL 56*Myrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and divedheadfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishingfrom sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she hadcome to rest somewhere in the U-bend.Harry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but Hermione shruggedwearily and said, \"Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle ....Come on, let's go.\"Harry had barely closed the door on Myrtle's gurgling sobs when aloud voice made all three of them jump.\"RON!\"Percy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs, prefectbadge agleam, an expression of complete shock on his face.\"That's a girls' bathroom!\" he gasped. \"What were you -?\"\"Just having a look around,\" Ron shrugged. \"Clues, you know -\"133Percy swelled in a manner that reminded Harry forcefully of Mrs.Weasley.\"Get - away - from - there -\" Perry said, striding toward them andstarting to bustle them along, flapping his arms. \"Don't you care whatthis looks like? Coming back here while everyone's at dinner -\"\"Why shouldn't we be here?\" said Ron hotly, stopping short and glaringat Percy. \"Listen, we never laid a finger on that cat!\"\"That's what I told Ginny,\" said Percy fiercely, \"but she still seems tothink you're going to be expelled, I've never seen her so upset, cryingher eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughlyoverexcited by this business -\"\"You don't care about Ginny,\" said Ron, whose ears were now*157*reddening. \"You're just worried I'm going to mess up your chances ofbeing Head Boy -\"\"Five points from Gryffindor!\" Percy said tersely, fingering his prefectbadge. \"And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more detective work, orI'll write to Mum!\"And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron's ears.Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percyin the common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper andkept blotting his Charms homework. When he reached absently for hiswand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almostas much as his homework, Ron slammed The Standard Book of Spells,Grade 2 shut. To Harry's surprise, Hermione followed suit.\"Who can it be, though?\" she said in a quiet voice, as thoughcontinuing a conversation they had just been having. \"Who'd want tofrighten all the Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?\"\"Let's think,\" said Ron in mock puzzlement. \"Who do we know whothinks Muggle-borns are scum?\"134He looked at Hermione. Hermione looked back, unconvinced.\"If you're talking about Malfoy -\"\"Of course I am!\" said Ron. \"You heard him - `You'll be next,Mudbloods!'- come on, you've only got to look at his foul rat face toknow it's him -\"\"Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?\" said Hermione skeptically.\"Look at his family,\" said Harry, closing his books, too. \"The whole lotof them have been in Slytherin; he's always boasting about it. Theycould easily be Slytherin's descendants. His father's definitely evilenough.\"*158*\"They couldve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries!\"said Ron. \"Handing it down, father to son ......\"Well,\" said Hermione cautiously, \"I suppose it's possible ......\"But how do we prove it?\" said Harry darkly.\"There might be a way,\" said Hermione slowly, dropping her voice stillfurther with a quick glance across the room at Percy. \"Of course, itwould be difficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We'd be breakingabout fifty school rules, I expect -\"\"If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know,won't you?\" said Ron irritably.\"All right,\" said Hermione coldly. \"What we'd need to do is to getinside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questionswithout him realizing it's us.\"\"But that's impossible,\" Harry said as Ron laughed.\"No, it's not,\" said Hermione. \"All we'd need would be some PolyjuicePotion.\"\"What's that?\" said Ron and Harry together.135\"Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago -\"\"D'you think we've got nothing better to do in Potions than listen toSnape?\" muttered Ron.\"It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We couldchange into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us.Malfoy would probably tell us anything. He's probably boasting about itin the Slytherin common room right now, if only we could hear him.\"\"This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,\" said Ron, frowning.\"What if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?\"\"It wears off after a while,\" said Hermione, waving her hand*159*impatiently. \"But getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult.Snape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it'sbound to be in the Restricted Section of the library.\"There was only one way to get out a book from the RestrictedSection: You needed a signed note of permission from a teacher.\"Hard to see why we'd want the book, really,\" said Ron, \"if weweren't going to try and make one of the potions.\"\"I think,\" said Hermione, \"that if we made it sound as thoughwe were just interested in the theory, we might stand a chance ......\"Oh, come on, no teacher's going to fall for that,\" said Ron.\"They'd have to be really thick . . . .\"ince the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor Lockhart had notbrought live creatures to class. Instead, he read passages from hisbooks to them, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramaticbits. He usually picked Harry to help him with these reconstructions;so far, Harry had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villagerwhom Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a headcold, and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything exceptlettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him.136Harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very nextDefense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this time acting a werewolf Ifhe hadn't had a very good reason for keeping Lockhart in a goodmood, he would have refused to do it.managed to hold him down - with my other, I*161*put my wand to his throat -I then screwed up my remaining strengthand performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm - he letout a piteous moan - go on, Harry - higher than that - good - the furvanished - the fangs shrank - and he turned back into a man. Simple,yet effective - and another village will remember me forever as thehero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolfattacks.\"The bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet.\"Homework - compose a poem about my defeat of the WaggaWagga Werewolf! Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of thebest one!\"The class began to leave. Harry returned to the back of the room,where Ron and Hermione were waiting.\"Ready?\" Harry muttered.\"Wait till everyone's gone,\" said Hermione nervously. \"All right . . . \"She approached Lockhart's desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly inher hand, Harry and Ron right behind her.\"Er - Professor Lockhart?\" Hermione stammered. \"I wanted to - toget this book out of the library. Just for background reading.\" Sheheld out the piece of paper, her hand shaking slightly. \"But the thingis, it's in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to137sign for it - I'm sure it would help me understand what you say inGadding with Ghouls about slow-acting venoms\"Ah, Gadding with Ghouls!\" said Lockhart, taking the note fromHermione and smiling widely at her. \"Possibly my very favoritebook. You enjoyed it?\"-162\"Oh, yes,\" said Hermione eagerly. \"So clever, the way you trapped thatlast one with the tea-strainer -\"\"Well, I'm sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the yeara little extra help,\" said Lockhart warmly, and he pulled out anenormous peacock quill. \"Yes, nice, isn't it?\" he said, misreading therevolted look on Ron's face. \"I usually save it for book-signings.\"He scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed itback to Hermione.\"So, Harry,\" said Lockhart, while Hermione folded the note withfumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag. \"Tomorrow's the firstQuidditch match of the season, I believe? Gryffindor against Slytherin,is it not? I hear you're a useful player. I was a Seeker, too. I wasasked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my lifeto the eradication of the Dark Forces. Still, if ever you feel the needfor a little private training, don't hesitate to ask. Always happy to passon my expertise to less able players ......Harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off afterRon and Hermione.\"I don't believe it,\" he said as the three of them examined the signatureon the note. \"He didn't even look at the book we wanted.\"\"That's because he's a brainless git,\" said Ron. \"But who cares, we'vegot what we needed -\"\"He is not a brainless git,\" said Hermione shrilly as they half rantoward the library.\"Just because he said you were the best student of the year -\"138They dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of thelibrary. Madam Pince, the librarian, was a thin, irritable woman wholooked like an underfed vulture.*163*\"Moste Potente Potions?\" she repeated suspiciously, trying to take thenote from Hermione; but Hermione wouldn't let go.\"I was wondering if I could keep it,\" she said breathlessly.\"Oh, come on,\" said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting itat Madam Pince. \"We'll get you another autograph. Lockhart'll signanything if it stands still long enough.\"Madam Pince held the note up to the light, as though determined todetect a forgery, but it passed the test. She stalked away between thelofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large andmoldy-looking book. Hermione put it carefully into her bag and theyleft, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty.Five minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle's out-oforderbathroom once again. Hermione had overridden Ron's objectionsby pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right mindswould go, so they were guaranteed some privacy. Moaning Myrtlewas crying noisily in her stall, but they were ignoring her, and shethem.Hermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and the three ofthem bent over the damp-spotted pages. It was clear from a glancewhy it belonged in the Restricted Section. Some of the potions hadeffects almost too gruesome to think about, and there were some veryunpleasant illustrations, which included a man who seemed to havebeen turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs ofarms out of her head.\"Here it is,\" said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed ThePolyjuice Potion. It was decorated with drawings of people halfwaythrough transforming into other people. Harry sin*164*139cerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on theirfaces.\"This is the most complicated potion I've ever seen,\" said Hermione asthey scanned the recipe. \"Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, andknotgrass,\" she murmured, running her finger down the list ofingredients. \"Well, they're easy enough, they're in the student storecupboard,we can help ourselves .... Oooh, look, powdered horn of abicorn - don't know where we're going to get that - shredded skin of aboomslang -. that'll be tricky, too and of course a bit of whoever wewant to change into.\"\"Excuse me?\" said Ron sharply. \"What d'you mean, a bit of whoeverwe're changing into? I'm drinking nothing with Crabbe's toenails in it -\"Hermione continued as though she hadn't heard him.\"We don't have to worry about that yet, though, because we add thosebits last ......Ron turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another worry.\"D'you realize how much we're going to have to steal, Hermione?Shredded skin of a boomslang, that's definitely not in the students'cupboard. What're we going to do, break into Snape's private stores? Idon't know if this is a good idea ......Hermione shut the book with a snap.\"Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,\" she said. There werebright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter thanusual. \"I don't want to break rules, you know. I think threateningMuggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. But ifyou don't want to find out if it's Malfoy, I'll go straight to Madam Pincenow and hand the book back in ='*165\"I never thought Id see the day when you'd be persuading us tobreak rules,\" said Ron. \"All right, we'll do it. But not toenails, okay?\"140\"How long will it take to make, anyway?\" said Harry as Hermione,looking happier, opened the book again.\"Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon andthe lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days ... I'd sayit'd be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients.\"\"A month?\" said Ron. \"Malfoy could have attacked half the Mugglebornsin the school by then!\" But Hermione's eyes narroweddangerously again, and he added swiftly, \"But it's the best plan we'vegot, so full steam ahead, I say.\"However, while Hermione was checking that the coast was clear forthem to leave the bathroom, Ron muttered to Harry, \"It'll be a lot lesshassle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow.Harry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinkingabout the coming Quidditch match. He was nervous, mainly at thethought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at theidea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms goldcould buy. He had never wanted to beat Slytherin so badly. Afterhalf an hour of lying there with his insides churning, he got up,dressed, and went down to breakfast early, where he found the restof the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty table, all lookinguptight and not speaking much.As eleven o'clock approached, the whole school started to make itsway down to the Quidditch stadium. It was a muggy sort of day*166*with a hint of thunder in the air. Ron and Hermione came hurryingover to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms. Theteam pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down to listen toWood's usual pre-match pep talk.\"Slytherin has better brooms than us,\" he began. \"No point denying it.But we've got better people on our brooms. We've trained harder thanthey have, we've been flying in all weathers -\" (\"Too true,\" mutteredGeorge Weasley. \"I haven't been properly dry since August\") \"- andwe're going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime,Malfoy, buy his way onto their team.\"141Chest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry.\"It'll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a Seeker has to havesomething more than a rich father. Get to that Snitch before Malfoy ordie trying, Harry, because we've got to win today, we've got to.\"\"So no pressure, Harry\" said Fred, winking at him.As they walked out onto the pitch, a roar of noise greeted them; mainlycheers, because Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to seeSlytherin beaten, but the Slytherins in the crowd made their boos andhisses heard, too. Madam Hooch, the Quidditch teacher, asked Flintand Wood to shake hands, which they did, giving each otherthreatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary.\"On my whistle,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Three ... two ... one. . .With a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, the fourteenplayers rose toward the leaden sky. Harry flew higher than any ofthem, squinting around for the Snitch.*167*\"All right there, Scarhead?\" yelled Malfoy, shooting underneath him asthough to show off the speed of his broom.Harry had no time to reply. At that very moment, a heavy blackBludger came pelting toward him; he avoided it so narrowly that hefelt it ruffle his hair as it passed.\"Close one, Harry!\" said George, streaking past him with his club in hishand, ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slytherin. Harry sawGeorge give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of AdrianPucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straightfor Harry again.Harry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George managed to hit it hardtoward Malfoy. Once again, the Bludger swerved like a boomerangand shot at Harry's head.Harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the142pitch. He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him. Whatwas going on? Bludgers never concentrated on one player like this; itwas their job to try and unseat as many people as possible ....Fred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other end. Harryducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might; the Bludgerwas knocked off course.\"Gotcha!\" Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as though it wasmagnetically attracted to Harry, the Bludger pelted after him oncemore and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed.It had started to rain; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face,splattering onto his glasses. He didn't have a clue what was going onin the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan, who wascommentating, say, \"Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero ='*168*The Slytherins' superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, andmeanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harryout of the air. Fred and George were now flying so close to him oneither side that Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing armsand had no chance to look for the Snitch, let alone catch it.\"Someone's - tampered - with - this - Bludger -\" Fred grunted,swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack onHarry.\"We need time out,\" said George, trying to signal to Wood and stopthe Bludger breaking Harry's nose at the same time.Wood had obviously got the message. Madam Hooch's whistle rangout and Harry, Fred, and George dived for the ground, still trying toavoid the mad Bludger.\"What's going on?\" said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddledtogether, while Slytherins in the crowd jeered. \"We're beingflattened. Fred, George, where were you when that Bludger stoppedAngelina scoring?\"\"We were twenty feet above her, stopping the other Bludger from143murdering Harry, Oliver,\" said George angrily. \"Someone's fixed it -it won't leave Harry alone. It hasn't gone for anyone else all game.The Slytherins must have done something to it.\"\"But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch's office sinceour last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then . . . . \"said Wood, anxiously.Madam Hooch was walking toward them. Over her shoulder, Harrycould see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction.169\"Listen,\" said Harry as she came nearer and nearer, \"with you twoflying around me all the time the only way I'm going to catch theSnitch is if it flies up my sleeve. Go back to the rest of the team andlet me deal with the rogue one.\"\"Don't be thick,\" said Fred. \"It'll take your head off.\"Wood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys.(I Oliver, this is insane,\" said Alicia Spinner angrily. \"You can't let Harrydeal with that thing on his own. Let's ask for an inquiry -))\"If we stop now, we'll have to forfeit the match!\" said Harry. \"Andwe're not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger! Comeon, Oliver, tell them to leave me alone!\"\"This is all your fault,\" George said angrily to Wood. \" `Get the Snitchor die trying,' what a stupid thing to tell him -\"Madam Hooch had joined them.\"Ready to resume play?\" she asked Wood.Wood looked at the determined look on Harry's face.\"All right,\" he said. \"Fred, George, you heard Harry -leave him aloneand let him deal with the Bludger on his own.\"The rain was falling more heavily now. On Madam Hooch's whistle,144Harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of theBludger behind him. Higher and higher Harry climbed; he looped andswooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled. Slightly dizzy, he neverthelesskept his eyes wide open, rain was speckling his glasses and ran up hisnostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from theBludger. He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he mustlook very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn't changedirection as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind of roller-coasterride around the*170*edges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to theGryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get pastWoodA whistling in Harry's ear told him the Bludger had just missed himagain; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction.\"Training for the ballet, Potter?\" yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced todo a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, theBludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back atMalfoy in hatred, he saw it - the Golden Snitch. It was hovering inchesabove Malfoy's left ear - and Malfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn'tseen it.For an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not daring to speedtoward Malfoy in case he looked up and saw the Snitch.WHAM.He had stayed still a second too long. The Bludger had hit him at last,smashed into his elbow, and Harry felt his arm break. Dimly, dazed bythe searing pain in his arm, he slid sideways on his rain-drenchedbroom, one knee still crooked over it, his right arm dangling useless athis side - the Bludger came pelting back for a second attack, this timeW-ming at his face - Harry swerved out of the way, one idea firmlylodged in his numb brain: get to Malfoy.Through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering, sneeringface below him and saw its eyes widen with fear: Malfoy thoughtHarry was attacking him.145\"What the -\" he gasped, careening out of Harry's way.Harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch;he felt his fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only*171*gripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the crowdbelow as he headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to passout.With a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom. Hisarm was hanging at a very strange angle; riddled with pain, he heard,as though from a distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting. Hefocused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand.\"Aha,\" he said vaguely. \"We've won.\"And he fainted.He came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, withsomeone leaning over him. He saw a glitter of teeth.\"Oh, no, not you,\" he moaned.\"Doesn't know what he's saying,\" said Lockhart loudly to the anxiouscrowd of Gryffindors pressing around them. \"Not to worry, Harry.I'm about to fix your arm.\"\"No!\"said Harry. \"I'll keep it like this, thanks ......He tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. He heard a familiarclicking noise nearby.\"I don't want a photo of this, Colin,\" he said loudly.\"Lie back, Harry,\" said Lockhart soothingly. \"It's a simple charm I'veused countless times -\"\"Why can't I just go to the hospital wing?\" said Harry throughclenched teeth.146\"He should really, Professor,\" said a muddy Wood, who couldn'thelp grinning even though his Seeker was injured. \"Great capture,Harry, really spectacular, your best yet, Id say -\"Through the thicket of legs around him, Harry spotted Fred and*112*George Weasley, wrestling the rogue Bludger into a box. It was stillputting up a terrific fight.\"Stand back,\" said Lockhart, who was rolling up his jade-greensleeves.\"No - don't -\" said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was twirling his wandand a second later had directed it straight at Harry's arm.A strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry's shoulder andspread all the way down to his fingertips. It felt as though his arm wasbeing deflated. He didn't dare look at what was happening. He hadshut his eyes, his face turned away from his arm, but his worst fearswere realized as the people above him gasped and Colin Creeveybegan clicking away madly. His arm didn't hurt anymore - nor did itfeel remotely like an arm.\"Ah,\" said Lockhart. \"Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. But thepoint is, the bones are no longer broken. That's the thing to bear inmind. So, Harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing - ah, Mr. Weasley,Miss Granger, would you escort him? - and Madam Pomfrey will beable to - er - tidy you up a bit.\"As Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided. Taking a deepbreath he looked down at his right side. What he saw nearly made himpass out again.Poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, fleshcoloredrubber glove. He tried to move his fingers. Nothing happened.Lockhart hadn't mended Harry's bones. He had removed them.Madam Pomfrey wasn't at all pleased.147\"You should have come straight to me!\" she raged, holding up*173*the sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been aworking arm. \"I can mend bones in a second - but growing them back -\"\"You will be able to, won't you?\" said Harry desperately.\"I'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful,\" said Madam Pomfreygrimly, throwing Harry a pair of pajamas. \"You'll have to stay thenight ......Hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry's bed whileRon helped him into his pajamas. It took a while to stuff the rubbery,boneless arm into a sleeve.\"How can you stick up for Lockhart now, Hermione, eh?\" Ron calledthrough the curtain as he pulled Harry's limp fingers through the cuff.\"If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked.\"\"Anyone can make a mistake,\" said Hermione. \"And it doesn't hurtanymore, does it, Harry?\"\"No,\" said Harry, getting into bed. \"But it doesn't do anything elseeither.\"As he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped pointlessly.Hermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the curtain. MadamPomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled Skele-Gro.\"You're in for a rough night,\" she said, pouring out a steamingbeakerful and handing it to him. \"Regrowing bones is a nasty business.So was taking the Skele-Gro. It burned Harry's mouth and throat as itwent down, making him cough and splutter. Still tut-tutting aboutdangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey re*114*148treated, leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down somewater.\"We won, though,\" said Ron, a grin breaking across his face.\"That was some catch you made. Malfoy's face ... he looked readyto kill ......\"I want to know how he fixed that Bludger,\" said Hermionedarkly.\"We can add that to the list of questions we'll ask him whenwe've taken the Polyjuice Potion,\" said Harry, sinking back ontohis pillows. \"I hope it tastes better than this stuff .....\"If it's got bits of Slytherins in it? You've got to be joking,\" saidRon.The door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment. Filthyand soaking wet, the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to seeHarry.\"Unbelievable flying, Harry,\" said George. \"I've just seen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy. Something about having the Snitch ontop of his head and not noticing. Malfoy didn't seem too happy.\"They had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice;they gathered around Harry's bed and were just getting started onwhat promised to be a good party when Madam Pomfrey camestorming over, shouting, \"This boy needs rest, he's got thirty-threebones to regrow! Out! OUT!\"And Harry was left alone, with nothing to distract him from thestabbing pains in his limp arm.Hours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in the pitchblackness and gave a small yelp of pain: His arm now felt full oflarge splinters. For a second, he thought that was what had wokenhim. Then, with a thrill of horror, he realized that someone wassponging his forehead in the dark.\"Get off!\" he said loudly, and then, \"Dobby!\"The house-elf's goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Harrythrough the darkness. A single tear was running down his long,pointed nose.\"Harry Potter came back to school,\" he whispered miserably.149\"Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter. Ah sir, why didn't youheed Dobby? Why didn't Harry Potter go back home when hemissed the train?\"Harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Dobby's spongeaway.\"What're you doing here?\" he said. \"And how did you know I missedthe train?\"Dobby's lip trembled and Harry was seized by a sudden suspicion.\"It was you!\" he said slowly. \"You stopped the barrier from letting usthrough!\"\"Indeed yes, sir,\" said Dobby, nodding his head vigorously, earsflapping. \"Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed thegateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward\" - he showedHarry ten long, bandaged fingers - \"but Dobby didn't care, sir, for hethought Harry Potter was safe, and never did Dobby dream that HarryPotter would get to school another way!\"He was rocking backward and forward, shaking his ugly head.\"Dobby was 'so shocked when he heard Harry Potter was back atHogwarts, he let his master's dinner burn! Such a flogging Dobbynever had, sir . .....*176*Harry slumped back onto his pillows.\"You nearly got Ron and me expelled,\" he said fiercely. \"You'd betterget lost before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you.\"Dobby smiled weakly.\"Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a dayat home.\"He blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore, lookingso pathetic that Harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself.150\"Why d'you wear that thing, Dobby?\" he asked curiously.\"This, sir?\" said Dobby, plucking at the pillowcase. \"'Tis a mark of thehouse-elf's enslavement, sir. Dobby can only be freed if his masterspresent him with clothes, sir. The family is careful not to pass Dobbyeven a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their houseforever.\"Dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly, \"Harry Potter mustgo home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make -\"\"Your Bludger?\" said Harry, anger rising once more. \"What d'youmean, your Bludger? You made that Bludger try and kill me?\"\"Not kill you, sir, never kill you!\" said Dobby, shocked. \"Dobby wantsto save Harry Potter's life! Better sent home, grievously injured, thanremain here sir! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt enough to besent home!\"\"Oh, is that all?\" said Harry angrily. \"I don't suppose you're going totell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces?\"\"Ah, if Harry Potter only knew!\" Dobby groaned, more tears drippingonto his ragged pillowcase. \"If he knew what he means*177*to us, to the lowly, the enslaved, we dregs of the magical world!Dobby remembers how it was when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Namedwas at the height of his powers, sir! We house-elfs were treated likevermin, sir! Of course, Dobby is still treated like that, sir,\" he admitted,drying his face on the pillowcase. \"But mostly, sir, life has improvedfor my kind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.Harry Potter survived, and the Dark Lord's power was broken, and itwas a new dawn, sir, and Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hopefor those of us who thought the Dark days would never end, sit... Andnow, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to happen, are perhaps happeningalready, and Dobby cannot let Harry Potter stay here now that historyis to repeat itself, now that the Chamber of Secrets is open once moreDobby froze, horrorstruck, then grabbed Harry's water jug from his151bedside table and cracked it over his own head, toppling out of sight. Asecond later, he crawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering,\"Bad Dobby, very bad Dobby. . .\"\"So there is a Chamber of Secrets?\" Harry whispered. \"And did yousay it's been opened before? Tell me, Dobby!\"He seized the elf's bony wrist as Dobby's hand inched toward thewater jug. \"But I'm not Muggle-born - how can I be in danger from theChamber?\"\"Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Dobby,\" stammered the elf,his eyes huge in the dark. \"Dark deeds are planned in this place, butHarry Potter must not be here when they happen - go home, HarryPotter, go home. Harry Potter must not meddle in this, sir, 'tis toodangerous -\"\"Who is it, Dobby?\" Harry said, keeping a firm hold on Dobby's*178*wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again. \"Who'sopened it? Who opened it last time?\"\"Dobby can't, sir, Dobby can't, Dobby mustn't tell!\" squealed the elf.\"Go home, Harry Potter, go home!\"\"I'm not going anywhere!\" said Harry fiercely. \"One of my bestfriends is Muggle-born; she'll be first in line if the Chamber really hasbeen opened -\"\"Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends!\" moaned Dobby in akind of miserable ecstasy. \"So noble! So valiant! But he must savehimself, he must, Harry Potter must not -\"Dobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering. Harry heard it, too.There were footsteps coming down the passageway outside.\"Dobby must go!\" breathed the elf, terrified. There was a loud crack,and Harry's fist was suddenly clenched on thin air. He slumped backinto bed, his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as thefootsteps drew nearer.152Next moment, Dumbledore was backing into the dormitory, wearing along woolly dressing gown and a nightcap. He was carrying one endof what looked like a statue. Professor McGonagall appeared asecond later, carrying its feet. Together, they heaved it onto a bed.\"Get Madam Pomfrey,\" whispered Dumbledore, and ProfessorMcGonagall hurried past the end of Harry's bed out of sight. Harry layquite still, pretending to be asleep. He heard urgent voices, and thenProfessor McGonagall swept back into view, closely followed byMadam Pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress.He heard a sharp intake of breath.\"What happened?\" Madam Pomfrey whispered to Dumbledore,bending over the statue on the bed.*l79*\"Another attack,\" said Dumbledore. \"Minerva found him on the stairs.\"There was a bunch of grapes next to him,\" said ProfessorMcGonagall. \"We think he was trying to sneak up here to visit Potter.\"Harry's stomach gave a horrible lurch. Slowly and carefully, he raisedhimself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed. A rayof moonlight lay across its staring face.It was Colin Creevey. His eyes were wide and his hands were stuckup in front of him, holding his camera.\"Petrified?\" whispered Madam Pomfrey.\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"But I shudder to think ... If Albushadn't been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate - who knowswhat might have -\"The three of them stared down at Colin. Then Dumbledore leanedforward and wrenched the camera out of Colin's rigid grip.\"You don't think he managed to get a picture of his attacker?\" saidProfessor McGonagall eagerly.153Dumbledore didn't answer. He opened the back of the camera.\"Good gracious!\" said Madam Pomfrey.A jet of steam had hissed out of the camera. Harry, three beds away,caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic.\"Melted,\" said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly. \"All melted...\"\"What does this mean, Albus?\" Professor McGonagall askedurgently.\"It means,\" said Dumbledore, \"that the Chamber of Secrets is indeedopen again.\"Madam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth. Professor McGonagallstared at Dumbledore.*180*\"But, Albus ... surely ... who?\"\"The question is not who,\" said Dumbledore, his eyes on Colin.\"The question is, how . . . .\"And from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall's shadowy face, she didn't understand this any better than he did.Harry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing withwinter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff. He sat up quicklyand looked over at Colin's bed, but it had been blocked from view bythe high curtains Harry had changed behind yesterday. Seeing that hewas awake, Madam Pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast trayand then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers.\"All in order,\" she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge lefthanded.\"When you've finished eating, you may leave.\"Harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to GryffindorTower, desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby,154but they weren't there. Harry left to look for them, wondering wherethey could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren'tinterested in whether he had his bones back or not.*182*As Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley strolled out of it,looking in far better spirits than last time they'd met.\"Oh, hello, Harry,\" he said. \"Excellent flying yesterday, reallyexcellent. Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup youearned fifty points!\"\"You haven't seen Ron or Hermione, have you?\" said Harry.\"No, I haven't,\" said Percy, his smile fading. \"I hope Ron's not inanother girls' toilet .....Harry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, and thenheaded straight for Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. He couldn't see whyRon and Hermione would be in there again, but after making surethat neither Filch nor any prefects were around, he opened the doorand heard their voices coming from a locked stall.\"It's me,\" he said, closing the door behind him. There was a clunk, asplash, and a gasp from within the stall and he saw Hermione's eyepeering through the keyhole.`Harry!\" she said. \"You gave us such a fright - come in how's yourarm?\"\"Fine,\" said Harry, squeezing into the stall. An old cauldron wasperched on the toilet, and a crackling from under the rim told Harrythey had lit a fire beneath it. Conjuring up portable, waterproof fireswas a speciality of Hermione's.\"We'd've come to meet you, but we decided to get started on thePolyjuice Potion,\" Ron explained as Harry, with difficulty, locked thestall again. \"We've decided this is the safest place to hide it.\"155Harry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione interrupted.\"We already know - we heard Professor McGonagall tellingProfessor Flitwick this morning. That's why we decided we'd better getgoing -\"\"The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the better,\" snarledRon. \"D'you know what I think? He was in such a foul temper afterthe Quidditch match, he took it out on Colin.\"\"There's something else,\" said Harry, watching Hermione tearingbundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion. \"Dobby cameto visit me in the middle of the night.\"Ron and Hermione looked up, amazed. Harry told them everythingDobby had told him - or hadn't told him. Hermione and Ron listenedwith their mouths open.\"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?\" Hermione said.\"This settles it,\" said Ron in a triumphant voice. \"Lucius Malfoy must'veopened the Chamber when he was at school here and now he's tolddear old Draco how to do it. It's obvious. Wish Dobby'd told you whatkind of monster's in there, though. I want to know how come nobody'snoticed it sneaking around the school.\"\"Maybe it can make itself invisible,\" said Hermione, prodding leeches tothe bottom of the cauldron. \"Or maybe it can disguise itself - pretend tobe a suit of armor or something - I've read about Chameleon Ghouls -\"\"You read too much, Hermione,\" said Ron, pouring dead lacewings ontop of the leeches. He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and lookedat Harry.\"So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke yourarm He shook his head. \"You know what, Harry? If he doesn'tstop trying to save your life he's going to kill you.\"*184*156The news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lyingas though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entireschool by Monday morning. The air was suddenly thick with rumorand suspicion. The first years were now moving around the castle intight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if theyventured forth alone.Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, wasdistraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going thewrong way about cheering her up. They were taking turns coveringthemselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behindstatues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, toldthem he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ginny washaving nightmares.Meanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans,amulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school.Neville Longbottom bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, apointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the otherGryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger; he was a pureblood,and therefore unlikely to be attacked.\"They went for Filch first,\" Neville said, his round face fearful. \"Andeveryone knows I'm almost a Squib.\"In the second week of December Professor McGonagall camearound as usual, collecting names of those who would be staying atschool for Christmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; theyhad heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck them as verysuspicious. The holidays would be the perfect time to use thePolyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him.Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still* 3-85*needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only placethey were going to get them was from Snape's private stores. Harryprivately felt he'd rather face Slytherin's legendary monster than letSnape catch him robbing his office.157\"What we need,\" said Hermione briskly as Thursday afternoon'sdouble Potions lesson loomed nearer, \"is a diversion. Then one of uscan sneak into Snape's office and take what we need.\"Harry and Ron looked at her nervously.\"I think Id better do the actual stealing,\" Hermione continued in amatter-of-fact tone. \"You two will be expelled if you get into any moretrouble, and I've got a clean record. So all you need to do is causeenough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.Harry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape's Potionsclass was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursdayafternoon's lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldronsstood steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brassscales and jars of ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes,making waspish remarks about the Gryffindors' work while theSlytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who was Snape'sfavorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry, whoknew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than youcould say \"Unfair.\"Harry's Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his mind onmore important things. He was waiting for Hermione's signal, and hehardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery*186*potion. When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville, Hermionecaught Harry's eye and nodded.Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Fred'sFilibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with hiswand. The firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had onlyseconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; itlanded right on target in Goyle's cauldron.Goyle's potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shriekedas splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. Malfoy got a faceful andhis nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his158hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate -Snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened.Through the confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape'soffice.\"Silence! SILENCE!\" Snape roared. \"Anyone who has been splashed,come here for a Deflating Draft - when I find out who did this -\"Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, his headdrooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half theclass lumbered up to Snape's desk, some weighted down with armslike clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffedup lips, Harrysaw Hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robesbulging.When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellingshad subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle's cauldron and scooped outthe twisted black remains of the firework. There was a sudden hush.*187*\"If I ever find out who threw this,\" Snape whispered, \"I shall makesure that person is expelled.\"Harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzledexpression. Snape was looking right at him, and the bell that rang tenminutes later could not have been more welcome.\"He knew it was me,\" Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurriedback to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. \"I could tell.\"Hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began tostir feverishly.\"It'll be ready in two weeks,\" she said happily.\"Snape can't prove it was you,\" said Ron reassuringly to Harry.\"What can he do?\"\"Knowing Snape, something foul,\" said Harry as the potion frothedand bubbled.159A week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking across theentrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered aroundthe notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just beenpinned up. Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned themover, looking excited.\"They're starting a Dueling Club!\" said Seamus. \"First meetingtonight! I wouldn't mind dueling lessons; they might come in handyone of these days ......\"What, you reckon Slytherin's monster can duel?\" said Ron, but he,too, read the sign with interest.\"Could be useful,\" he said to Harry and Hermione as they went intodinner. \"Shall we go?\"Harry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o'clock that*188*evening they hurried back to the Great Hall. The long dining tableshad vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit bythousands of candles floating overhead. The ceiling was velvetyblack once more and most of the school seemed to be packedbeneath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited.\"I wonder who'll be teaching us?\" said Hermione as they edged intothe chattering crowd. \"Someone told me Flitwick was a duelingchampion when he was young - maybe it'll be him.\"\"As long as it's not -\" Harry began, but he ended on a groan:Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robesof deep plum and accompanied by none other than Snape, wearinghis usual black.Lockhart waved an arm for silence and called ' \"Gather round,gather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me?Excellent!\"Now, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to startthis little dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defendyourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions - for full160details, see my published works.\"Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape,\" said Lockhart,flashing a wide smile. \"He tells me he knows a tiny little bit aboutdueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a shortdemonstration before we begin. Now, I don't want any of youyoungsters to worry - you'll still have your Potions master when I'mthrough with him, never fear!\"\"Wouldn't it be good if they finished each other off?\" Ron muttered inHarry's ear.Snape's upper lip was curling. Harry wondered why Lockhart*189*was still smiling; if Snape had been looking at him like that he'd havebeen running as fast as he could in the opposite direction.Lockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed; at least,Lockhart did, with much twirling of his hands, whereas Snape jerkedhis head irritably. Then they raised their wands like swords in front ofthem.\"As you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combativeposition,\" Lockhart told the silent crowd. \"On the count of three, wewill cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.\"\"I wouldn't bet on that,\" Harry murmured, watching Snape baring histeeth.\"One - two - three -\"Both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed themat their opponent; Snape cried: \"Expelliarmus!\" There was a dazzlingflash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flewbackward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it tosprawl on the floor.Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered. Hermione wasdancing on tiptoes. \"Do you think he's all right?\" she squealed throughher fingers.161\"Who cares?\" said Harry and Ron together.Lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat had fallen off andhis wavy hair was standing on end.\"Well, there you have it!\" he said, tottering back onto the platform.\"That was a Disarming Charm - as you see, I've lost my wand - ah,thank you, Miss Brown - yes, an excellent idea to show them that,Professor Snape, but if you don't mind my saying*190*so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted tostop you it would have been only too easy - however, I felt it would beinstructive to let them see . . .\"Snape was looking murderous. Possibly Lockhart had noticed, becausehe said, \"Enough demonstrating! I'm going to come amongst you nowand put you all into pairs. Professor Snape, if you'd like to help me -\"They moved through the crowd, matching up partners. Lockhartteamed Neville with Justin Finch-Fletchley, but Snape reached Harryand Ron first.\"Time to split up the dream team, I think,\" he sneered. \"Weasley, youcan partner Finnigan. Potter -\"Harry moved automatically toward Hermione.\"I don't think so,\" said Snape, smiling coldly. \"Mr. Malfoy, come overhere. Let's see what you make of the famous Potter. And you, MissGranger - you can partner Miss Bulstrode.\"Malfoy strutted over, smirking. Behind him walked a Slytherin girl whoreminded Harry of a picture he'd seen in Holidays with Hags. She waslarge and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermionegave her a weak smile that she did not return.\"Face your partners!\" called Lockhart, back on the platform. \"Andbow!\"162Harry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes offeach other.\"Wands at the ready!\" shouted Lockhart. \"When I count to three, castyour charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm them - we don'twant any accidents - one ... two ... three -\"*191*Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on \"two\":His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he'd been hit over thehead with a saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to beworking, and wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight atMalfoy and shouted, \"Rictusempra!\"A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up,wheezing.\"I said disarm only!\" Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of thebattling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his knees; Harry had hit him with aTickling Charm, and he could barely move for laughing. Harry hungback, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch Malfoywhile he was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath,Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry's knees, choked, \"Tarantallegra!\"and the next second Harry's legs began to jerk around out of hiscontrol in a kind of quickstep.\"Stop! Stop!\" screamed Lockhart, but Snape took charge.\"Finite Incantatem!\" he shouted; Harry's feet stopped dancing, Malfoystopped laughing, and they were able to look up.A haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene. Both Nevilleand Justin were lying on the floor, panting; Ron was holding up anashen-faced Seamus, apologizing for whatever his broken wand haddone; but Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still moving;Millicent had Hermione in a headlock and Hermione was whimperingin pain; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor. Harry leaptforward and pulled Millicent off. It was difficult: She was a lot biggerthan he was.\"Dear, dear,\" said Lockhart, skittering through the crowd, looking at163the aftermath of the duels. \"Up you go, Macmillan ....*192*Careful there, Miss Fawcett .... Pinch it hard, it'll stop bleeding in asecond, Boot\"I think Id better teach you how to block unfriendly spells,\" saidLockhart, standing flustered in the midst of the hall. He glanced atSnape, whose black eyes glinted, and looked quickly away. \"Let'shave a volunteer pair - Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley, how aboutyou -\"\"A bad idea, Professor Lockhart,\" said Snape, gliding over like a largeand malevolent bat. \"Longbottom causes devastation with the simplestspells. We'll be sending what's left of Finch-Fletchley up to thehospital wing in a matchbox.\" Neville's round, pink face went pinker.\"How about Malfoy and Potter?\" said Snape with a twisted smile.\"Excellent idea!\" said Lockhart, gesturing Harry and Malfoy into themiddle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room.\"Now, Harry,\" said Lockhart. \"When Draco points his wand at you,you do this.\"He raised his own wand, attempted a complicated sort of wigglingaction, and dropped it. Snape smirked as Lockhart quickly picked it up,saying, \"Whoops -my wand is a little overexcited -\"Snape moved closer to Malfoy, bent down, and whispered somethingin his ear. Malfoy smirked, too. Harry looked up nervously at Lockhartand said, \"Professor, could you show me that blocking thing again?\"\"Scared?\" muttered Malfoy, so that Lockhart couldn't hear him.\"You wish,\" said Harry out of the corner of his mouth.Lockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder. \"Just do what I did,Harry!\"\"What, drop my wand?\"164But Lockhart wasn't listening.\"Three - two - one - go!\" he shouted.Malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed, \"Serpensortia!\"The end of his wand exploded. Harry watched, aghast, as a long blacksnake shot out of it, fell heavily onto the floor between them, andraised itself, ready to strike. There were screams as the crowdbacked swiftly away, clearing the floor.\"Don't move, Potter,\" said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight ofHarry standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake. \"I'll getrid of it ......\"Allow me!\" shouted Lockhart. He brandished his wand at the snakeand there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew tenfeet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged,hissing furiously, it slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley andraised itself again, fangs exposed, poised to strike.Harry wasn't sure what made him do it. He wasn't even aware ofdeciding to do it. All he knew was that his legs were carrying himforward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidlyat the snake, \"Leave him alone!\" And miraculously - inexplicably - thesnake slumped to the floor, docile as a thick, black garden hose, itseyes now on Harry. Harry felt the fear drain out of him. He knew thesnake wouldn't attack anyone now, though how he knew it, he couldn'thave explained.He looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see Justin looking*194*relieved, or puzzled, or even grateful - but certainly not angry andscared.\"What do you think you're playing at?\" he shouted, and before Harrycould say anything, Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall.Snape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the snake vanished in asmall puff of black smoke. Snape, too, was looking at Harry in an165unexpected way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and Harrydidn't like it. He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering allaround the walls. Then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes.\"Come on,\" said Rods voice in his ear. \"Move - come on -\"Ron steered him out of the hall, Hermione hurrying alongside them. Asthey went through the doors, the people on either side drew away asthough they were frightened of catching something. Harry didn't havea clue what was going on, and neither Ron nor Hermione explainedanything until they had dragged him all the way up to the emptyGryffindor common room. Then Ron pushed Harry into an armchairand said, \"You're a Parselmouth. Why didn't you tell us?\"\"I'm a what?\" said Harry.`A Parselmouth!\" said Ron. \"You can talk to snakes!\"\"I know,\" said Harry. \"I mean, that's only the second time I've everdone it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at thezoo once - long story - but it was telling me it had never seen Braziland I sort of set it free without meaning to that was before I knew Iwas a wizard -\"\"A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?\" Ron repeatedfaintly.*195*\"So?\" said Harry. \"I bet loads of people here can do it.\"\"Oh, no they can't,\" said Ron. \"It's not a very common gift. Harry, thisis bad.\"\"What's bad?\" said Harry, starting to feel quite angry. \"What's wrongwith everyone? Listen, if I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin -\"\"Oh, that's what you said to it?\"\"What d'you mean? You were there - you heard me -\"\"I heard you speaking Parseltongue,\" said Ron. \"Snake language. You166could have been saying anything - no wonder Justin panicked, yousounded like you were egging the snake on or something - it wascreepy, you know -\"Harry gaped at him.\"I spoke a different language? But - I didn't realize - how can I speaka language without knowing I can speak it?\"Ron shook his head. Both he and Hermione were looking as thoughsomeone had died. Harry couldn't see what was so terrible.\"D'you want to tell me what's wrong with stopping a massive snakebiting off Justin's head?\" he said. \"What does it matter how I did it aslong as Justin doesn't have to join the Headless Hunt?\"\"It matters,\" said Hermione, speaking at last in a hushed voice,\"because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin wasfamous for. That's why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.\"Harry's mouth fell open.\"Exactly,\" said Ron. \"And now the whole school's going to think you'rehis great-great-great-great-grandson or something -\"\"But I'm not,\" said Harry, with a panic he couldn't quite explain.\"You'll find that hard to prove,\" said Hermione. \"He lived about athousand years ago; for all we know, you could be.\"* IL96 *Harry lay awake for hours that night. Through a gap in the curtainsaround his four-poster he watched snow starting to drift past thetower window and wondered . . .Could he be a descendant of Salazar Slithering? He didn't knowanything about his father's family, after all. The Dursleys had alwaysforbidden questions about his wizarding relatives.Quietly, Harry tried to say something in Parseltongue. The wordswouldn't come. It seemed he had to be face-to-face with a snake to167do it.But I'm in Gryffindor, Harry thought. The Sorting Hat wouldn'thave put me in here if I had Slytherin blood...Ah, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the Sorting Hat wanted toput you in Slytherin, don't you remember?Harry turned over. He'd see Justin the next day in Herbology and he'dexplain that he'd been calling the snake off, not egging it on, which (hethought angrily, pummeling his pillow) any fool should have realized.By next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night hadturned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of theterm was canceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarveson the Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else,now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly andrevive Mrs. Norris and Colin Creevey.Harry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor commonroom, while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game ofwizard chess.\"For heaven's sake, Harry,\" said Hermione, exasperated, as one*197*of Ron's bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him offthe board. \"Go and find Justin if it's so important to you.\"So Harry got up and left through the portrait hole, wondering whereJustin might be.The castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of thethick, swirling gray snow at every window. Shivering, Harry walkedpast classrooms where lessons were taking place, catching snatches ofwhat was happening within. Professor McGonagall was shouting atsomeone who, by the sound of it, had turned his friend into a badger.Resisting the urge to take a look, Harry walked on by, thinking thatJustin might be using his free time to catch up on some work, anddeciding to check the library first.168A group of the Hufliepuffs who should have been in Herbology wereindeed sitting at the back of the library, but they didn't seem to beworking. Between the long lines of high bookshelves, Harry could seethat their heads were close together and they were having what lookedlike an absorbing conversation. He couldn't see whether Justin wasamong them. He was walking toward them when something of whatthey were saying met his ears, and he paused to listen, hidden in theInvisibility section.\"So anyway,\" a stout boy was saying, \"I told Justin to hide up in ourdormitory. I mean to say, if Potter's marked him down as his nextvictim, it's best if he keeps a low profile for a while. Of course, Justin'sbeen waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip toPotter he was Muggle-born. Justin actually told him he'd been downfor Eton. That's not the kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin'sheir on the loose, is it?\"\"You definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie?\" said a girl with blondepigtails anxiously.198\"Hannah,\" said the stout boy solemnly, \"he's a Parselmouth. Everyoneknows that's the mark of a Dark wizard. Have you ever heard of adecent one who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin himselfSerpent-tongue.\"There was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ernie went on,\"Remember what was written on the wall? Enemies of the Heir,Beware. Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing weknow, Flich's cat's attacked. That first year, Creevey, was annoyingPotter at the Quidditch match, taking pictures of him while he waslying in the mud. Next thing we know - Creevey's been attacked.\"\"He always seems so nice, though,\" said Hannah uncertainly, \"and,well, he's the one who made You-Know-Who disappear. He can't beall bad, can he?\"Ernie lowered his voice mysteriously, the Hufflepuffs bent closer, andHarry edged nearer so that he could catch Ernie's words.\"No one knows how he survived that attack by You-Know-Who. I169mean to say, he was only a baby when it happened. He should havebeen blasted into smithereens. Only a really powerful Dark wizardcould have survived a curse like that.\" He dropped his voice until itwas barely more than a whisper, and said, \"That's probably why You-Know-Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn't want anotherDark Lord competing with him. I wonder what other powers Potter'sbeen hiding?\"Harry couldn't take anymore. Clearing his throat loudly, he stepped outfrom behind the bookshelves. If he hadn't been feeling so angry, hewould have found the sight that greeted him funny: Every one of theHufflepuffs looked as though they had been Petrified by the sight ofhim, and the color was draining out of Ernie's face.*199*\"Hello,\" said Harry. \"I'm looking for Justin Finch-Fletchley.\"The Hufepuffs' worst fears had clearly been confirmed. They alllooked fearfully at Ernie.\"What do you want with him?\" said Ernie in a quavering voice.\"I wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at theDueling Club,\" said Harry.Ernie bit his white lips and then, taking a deep breath, said, \"Wewere all there. We saw what happened.\"\"Then you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake backed off?\"said Harry.\"All I saw,\" said Ernie stubbornly, though he was trembling as hespoke, \"was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snaketoward Justin. \"\"I didn't chase it at him!\" Harry said, his voice shaking with anger. \"Itdidn't even touch him!\"\"It was a very near miss,\" said Ernie. \"And in case you're gettingideas,\" he added hastily, \"I might tell you that you can trace myfamily back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and170my blood's as pure as anyone's, so -\"- cc I don't care what sort of blood you've got!\" said Harry fiercely.\"Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns?\"\"I've heard you hate those Muggles you live with,\" said Ernie swiftly.\"It's not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them,\" saidHarry. \"Id like to see you try it.\"He turned on his heel and stormed out of the library, earning himselfa reproving glare from Madam Pince, who was polishing the gildedcover of a large spellbook.*200*Harry blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where he was going,he was in such a fury. The result was that he walked into somethingvery large and solid, which knocked him backward onto the floor.\"Oh, hello, Hagrid,\" Harry said, looking up.Hagrid's face was entirely hidden by a woolly, snow-coveredbalaclava, but it couldn't possibly be anyone else, as he filled most ofthe corridor in his moleskin overcoat. A dead rooster was hangingfrom one of his massive, gloved hands.\"All righ', Harry?\" he said, pulling up the balaclava so he couldspeak. \"Why aren't yeh in class?\"\"Canceled,\" said Harry, getting up. \"What're you doing in here?\"Hagrid held up the limp rooster.\"Second one killed this term,\" he explained. \"It's either foxes or aBlood-Suckin Bugbear, an' I need the Headmaster's permission terput a charm around the hen coop.\"He peered more closely at Harry from under his thick, snowfleckedeyebrows.\"Yeh sure yeh're all righ'? Yeh look all hot an' bothered -\"171Harry couldn't bring himself to repeat what Ernie and the rest of theHufflepuffs had been saying about him.\"It's nothing,\" he said. \"Id better get going, Hagrid, it's Transfigurationnext and I've got to pick up my books.\"He walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had said about him.\"Justin's been waiting for something like this to happen ever since helet slip to Potter he was Muggle-born .....* 2 0 IL *Harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor,which was particularly dark; the torches had been extinguished by astrong, icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane. Hewas halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong oversomething lying on the floor.He turned to squint at what he'd fallen over and felt as though hisstomach had dissolved.Justin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look ofshock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. Andthat wasn't all. Next to him was another figure, the strangest sightHarry had ever seen.It was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white andtransparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal,six inches off the floor. His head was half off and his face wore anexpression of shock identical to Justin's.Harry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, his heart doing akind of drumroll against his ribs. He looked wildly up and down thedeserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as theycould away from the bodies. The only sounds were the muffledvoices of teachers from the classes on either side.He could run, and no one would ever know he had been there. Buthe couldn't just leave them lying here .... He had to get help ....Would anyone believe he hadn't had anything to do with this?172As he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him opened with abang. Peeves the Poltergeist came shooting out.\"Why, it's potty wee Potter!\" cackled Peeves, knocking Harry'sglasses askew as he bounced past him. \"What's Potter up to? Why'sPotter lurking -\"*202*Peeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault. Upside down,he spotted Justin and Nearly Headless Nick. He flipped the rightway up, filled his lungs and, before Harry could stop him, screamed,\"ATTACK! ATTACK! ANOTHER ATTACK! NO MORTALOR GHOST IS SAFE! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!ATTAAAACK!\"Crash - crash - crash - door after door flew open along the corridorand people flooded out. For several long minutes, there was a sceneof such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed andpeople kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick. Harry found himselfpinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet. ProfessorMcGonagall came running, followed by her own class, one of whomstill had black-and-white-striped hair. She used her wand to set offaloud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back intotheir classes. No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Erniethe Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene.\"Caught in the act!\" Ernie yelled, his face stark white, pointing hisfinger dramatically at Harry.\"That will do, Macmillan!\" said Professor McGonagall sharply.Peeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying thescene; Peeves always loved chaos. As the teachers bent over Justinand Nearly Headless Nick, examining them, Peeves broke into song:\"Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done,You're killing off' students, you think it's good fun -\"\"That's enough Peeves!\" barked Professor McGonagall, and Peeveszoomed away backward, with his tongue out at Harry.173*203*Justin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick andProfessor Sinistra of the Astronomy department, but nobody seemedto know what to do for Nearly Headless Nick. In the end, ProfessorMcGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air, which she gave toErnie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs.This Ernie did, fanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft. Thisleft Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together.\"This way, Potter,\" she said.\"Professor,\" said Harry at once, \"I swear I didn't -\"\"This is out of my hands, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall curtly.They marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before alarge and extremely ugly stone gargoyle.\"Lemon drop!\" she said. This was evidently a password, because thegargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behindhim split in two. Even full of dread for what was coming, Harrycouldn't fail to be amazed. Behind the wall was a spiral staircase thatwas moving smoothly upward, like an escalator. As he and ProfessorMcGonagall stepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed behindthem. They rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last,slightly dizzy, Harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brassknocker in the shape of a griffin.He knew now where he was being taken. This must be whereDumbledore lived.*204*hey stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and ProfessorMcGonagall rapped on the door. It opened silently and they entered.Professor McGonagall told Harry to wait and left him there, alone.174Harry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers'offices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore's was by farthe most interesting. If he hadn't been scared out of his wits that hewas about to be thrown out of school, he would have been verypleased to have a chance to look around it.It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. Anumber of curious silver instruments stood on spindlelegged tables,whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were coveredwith portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whomwere snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an enormous,claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tatteredwizard's hat - the Sorting Hat.*205*Harry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches andwizards on the walls. Surely it couldn't hurt if he took the hat downand tried it on again? Just to see ... just to make sure it had put him inthe right HouseHe walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, andlowered it slowly onto his head. It was much too large and slippeddown over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he'd put it on.Harry stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a small voicesaid in his ear, \"Bee in your bonnet, Harry Potter?\"\"Er, yes,\" Harry muttered. \"Er - sorry to bother you - I wanted to ask -\"\"You've been wondering whether I put you in the right House,\" saidthe hat smartly. \"Yes ... you were particularly difficult to place. But Istand by what I said before\" - Harry's heart leapt - \"you would havedone well in Slytherin -\"Harry's stomach plummeted. He grabbed the point of the hat andpulled it off. It hung limply in his hand, grubby and faded. Harrypushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick.175\"You're wrong,\" he said aloud to the still and silent hat. It didn't move.Harry backed away, watching it. Then a strange, gagging noise behindhim made him wheel around.He wasn't alone after all. Standing on a golden perch behind the doorwas a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey.Harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back, making itsgagging noise again. Harry thought it looked very ill. Its eyes were dulland, even as Harry watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail.Harry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore'spet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it, when the birdburst into flames.Harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk. He lookedfeverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere butcouldn't see one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gaveone loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smoulderingpile of ash on the floor.The office door opened. Dumbledore came in, looking very somber.\"Professor,\" Harry gasped. \"Your bird - I couldn't do anything - he justcaught fire -\"To Harry's astonishment, Dumbledore smiled.\"About time, too,\" he said. \"He's been looking dreadful for days; I'vebeen telling him to get a move on.\"He chuckled at the stunned look on Harry's face.\"Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it istime for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Watch him . . .\"Harry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird pokeits head out of the ashes. It was quite as ugly as the old one.\"It's a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day,\" said Dumbledore,seating himself behind his desk. \"He's really very handsome most ofthe time, wonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating creatures,176phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears havehealing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.\"In the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what hewas there for, but it all came back to him as Dumbledore settledhimself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with hispenetrating, light-blue stare.Before Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door ofthe office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wildlook in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black headand the dead rooster still swinging from his hand.\"It wasn' Harry, Professor Dumbledore!\" said Hagrid urgently. \"I wastalkin' ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir -\"Dumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went ranting on,waving the rooster around in his agitation, sending featherseverywhere.\"- it can't've bin him, I'll swear it in front o' the Ministry o' Magic if Ihave to -\"\"Hagrid, I -\"\"- yeh've got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never ='\"Hagrid!\" said Dumbledore loudly. \"I do not think that Harryattacked those people.\"\"Oh,\" said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side. \"Right. I'll waitoutside then, Headmaster.\"And he stomped out looking embarrassed.\"You don't think it was me, Professor?\" Harry repeated hopefully asDumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk.\"No, Harry, I don't,\" said Dumbledore, though his face was somberagain. \"But I still want to talk to you.\"177Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips ofhis long fingers together.*208*\"I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you'd like to tell me,\"he said gently. \"Anything at all.\"Harry didn't know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, \"You'llbe next, Mudbloods!\" and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away inMoaning Myrtle's bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodiedvoice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said:\"Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in thewizarding world.\" He thought, too, about what everyone was sayingabout him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connectedwith Salazar Slytherin ....\"No,\" said Harry. \"There isn't anything, Professor . . . .\"The double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick turned whathad hitherto been nervousness into real panic. Curiously, it was NearlyHeadless Nick's fate that seemed to worry people most. What couldpossibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other; what terriblepower could harm someone who was already dead? There wasalmost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so thatstudents could go home for Christmas.\"At this rate, we'll be the only ones left,\" Ron told Harry andHermione. \"Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. What a jolly holiday it'sgoing to be.\"Crabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had signedup to stay over the holidays, too. But Harry was glad that most peoplewere leaving. He was tired of people skirting around him in thecorridors, as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tiredof all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed.*209*Fred and George, however, found all this very funny. They went out oftheir way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting,178\"Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard comingthrough ......Percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior.\"It is not a laughing matter,\" he said coldly.\"Oh, get out of the way, Percy,\" said Fred. \"Harry's in a hurry.\"\"Yeah, he's off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with hisfanged servant,\" said George, chortling.Ginny didn't find it amusing either.\"Oh, don't,\" she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who hewas planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward Harryoff with a large clove of garlic when they met.Harry didn't mind; it made him feel better that Fred and George, atleast, thought the idea of his being Slytherin's heir was quite ludicrous.But their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who lookedincreasingly sour each time he saw them at it.\"It's because he's bursting to say it's really him,\" said Ron knowingly.\"You know how he hates anyone beating him at anything, and you'regetting all the credit for his dirty work.\"\"Not for long,\" said Hermione in a satisfied tone. \"The PolyjuicePotion's nearly ready. We'll be getting the truth out of him any daynow.\"At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the groundsdescended on the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy,and enjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the runof Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could*210*play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practicedueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay atschool rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.Percy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior,179didn't spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. He hadalready told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmasbecause it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers duringthis troubled time.Christmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry and Ron, the onlyones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione,who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both.\"Wake up,\" she said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window.\"Hermione - you're not supposed to be in here -\" said Ron, shieldinghis eyes against the light.\"Merry Christmas to you, too,\" said Hermione, throwing him hispresent. \"I've been up for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings tothe potion. It's ready.\"Harry sat up, suddenly wide awake.\"Are you sure?\"\"Positive,\" said Hermione, shifting Scabbers the rat so that she couldsit down on the end of Ron's four-poster. \"If we're going to do it, Isay it should be tonight.\"At that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room, carrying a verysmall package in her beak.\"Hello,\" said Harry happily as she landed on his bed. \"Are youspeaking to me again?\"211She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a farbetter present than the one that she had brought him, which turnedout to be from the Dursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and anote telling him to find out whether he'd be able to stay at Hogwartsfor the summer vacation, too.The rest of Harry's Christmas presents were far more satisfactory.Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge, which Harry decided180to soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a book calledFlying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favoriteQuidditch team, and Hermione had bought him a luxury eagle-featherquill. Harry opened the last present to find a new, hand-knittedsweater from Mrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her cardwith a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. Weasley's car (whichhadn't been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow), and thebout of rule-breaking he and Ron were planning next.No one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later,could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts.The Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozenfrost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly andmistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling,warm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of hisfavorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with everygoblet of eggnog he consumed. Percy, who hadn't noticed that Fredhad bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read \"Pinhead,\" keptasking them all what they were sniggering at. Harry didn't even carethat Draco Malfoy was making loud, snide remarks* 2:L2 *about his new sweater from the Slytherin table. With a bit of luck,Malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours' time.Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmaspudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize theirplans for the evening.\"We still need a bit of the people you're changing into,\" saidHermione matter-of-facdy, as though she were sending them to thesupermarket for laundry detergent. \"And obviously, it'll be best if youcan get something of Crabbe's and Goyle's; they're Malfoys bestfriends, he'll tell them anything. And we also need to make sure thereal Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogatinghim.\"I've got it all worked out,\" she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry'sand Ron's stupefied faces. She held up two plump chocolate cakes.\"I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is181make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them. You know how greedy theyare, they're bound to eat them. Once they're asleep, pull out a few oftheir hairs and hide them in a broom closet.\"Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other.\"Hermione, I don't think -\"\"That could go seriously wrong -\"But Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the oneProfessor McGonagall sometimes had.\"The potion will be useless without Crabbe's and Goyle's hair,\" shesaid sternly. \"You do want to investigate Malfoy, don't you?\"\"Oh, all right, all right,\" said Harry. \"But what about you? Whose hairare you ripping out?\"*213*\"I've already got mine!\" said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottleout of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it.\"Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the DuelingClub? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me!And she's gone home for Christmas - so I'll just have to tell theSlytherins I've decided to come back.\"When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potionagain, Ron turned to Harry with a doom-laden expression.\"Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could gowrong?\"But to Harry's and Ron's utter amazement, stage one of theoperation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said. They lurkedin the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbeand Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, shovelingdown fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had perched the chocolatecakes on the end of the banisters. When they spotted Crabbe andGoyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid quicklybehind a suit of armor next to the front door.182\"How thick can you get?\" Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbegleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them. Grinningstupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths. For amoment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on theirfaces. Then, without the smallest change of expression, they bothkeeled over backward onto the floor.By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall.Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harryyanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle's fore* _2 14 *head and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe's hairs. They also stoletheir shoes, because their own were far too small for Crabbe- andGoyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at what they had just done, theysprinted up to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stallin which Hermione was stirring the cauldron. Pulling their robes upover their faces, Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door.\"Hermione?\"They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shinyfacedand looking anxious. Behind her they heard the gloop gloopof the bubbling, glutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready onthe toilet seat.\"Did you get them?\" Hermione asked breathlessly.Harry showed her Goyle's hair.\"Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry,\" Hermionesaid, holding up a small sack. \"You'll need bigger sizes once you'reCrabbe and Goyle.\"The three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up, the potion lookedlike thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly.\"I'm sure I've done everything right,\" said Hermione, nervously183rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions. \"It looks like thebook says it should ... once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly an hourbefore we change back into ourselves.\"\"Now what?\" Ron whispered.\"We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.\"Hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses.Then, her hand trembling, she shook Millicent Bulstrode's hair out ofits bottle into the first glass.*215*The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. Asecond later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow.\"Urgh - essence of Millicent Bulstrode,\" said Ron, eyeing it withloathing. \"Bet it tastes disgusting.\"\"Add yours, then,\" said Hermione.Harry dropped Goyle's hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe'sinto the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle's turned thekhaki color of a booger, Crabbe's a dark, murky brown.\"Hang on,\" said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses.\"We'd better not all drink them in here .... Once we turn into Crabbeand Goyle we won't fit. And Millicent Bulstrode's no pixie.\"Good thinking,\" said Ron, unlocking the door. \"We'll take separatestalls.\"Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped intothe middle stall.\"Ready?\" he called.\"Ready,\" came Ron's and Hermione's voices.\"One - two - three -\"184Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in two large gulps. Ittasted like overcooked cabbage.Immediately, his insides started writhing as though he'd just swallowedlive snakes - doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to besick - then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to thevery ends of his fingers and toes - next, bringing him gasping to allfours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over his bodybubbled like hot wax - and before his eyes, his hands began to grow,the fingers thickened, the nails broadened,* 2116 *the knuckles were bulging like bolts -his shoulders stretched painfullyand a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping downtoward his eyebrows - his robes ripped as his chest expanded like abarrel bursting its hoops - his feet were agony in shoes four sizes toosmallAs suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. Harry lay facedownon the stone-cold floor, listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the endtoilet. With difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up. So this waswhat it felt like, being Goyle. His large hand trembling, he pulled offhis old robes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled onthe spare ones, and laced up Goyle's boatlike shoes. He reached up tobrush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wirybristles, low on his forehead. Then he realized that his glasses wereclouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn't need them - he tookthem off and called, \"Are you two okay?\" Goyle's low rasp of a voiceissued from his mouth.\"Yeah,\" came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right.Harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror.Goyle stared back at him out of dull, deepset eyes. Harry scratchedhis ear. So did Goyle.Ron's door opened. They stared at each other. Except that he lookedpale and shocked, Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe, from thepudding-bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms.\"This is unbelievable,\" said Ron, approaching the mirror and prodding185Crabbe's flat nose. \"Unbelievable. \"\"We'd better get going,\" said Harry, loosening the watch that wascutting into Goyle's thick wrist. \"We've still got to find out* 217*where the Slytherin common room is. I only hope we can findsomeone to follow. . .\"Ron, who had been gazing at Harry, said, \"You don't know howbizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.\" He banged on Hermione's door.\"C'mon, we need to go -\"A high-pitched voice answered him.\"I - I don't think I'm going to come after all. You go on without me.\"Hermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode's ugly, no one's going toknow it's you -\"\"No - really - I don't think I'll come. You two hurry up, you rewasting timeHarry looked at Ron, bewildered.\"That looks more like Goyle,\" said Ron. \"That's how he looks everytime a teacher asks him a question.\"\"Hermione, are you okay?\" said Harry through the door.\"Fine - I'm fine - go on -\"Harry looked at his watch. Five of their precious sixty minutes hadalready passed.\"We'll meet you back here, all right?\" he said.Harry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checkedthat the coast was clear, and set off.\"Don't swing your arms like that,\" Harry muttered to Ron.186\"Eh?\"\"Crabbe holds them sort of stiff . . . .\"\"How's this?\"\"Yeah, that's better . . . .\"They went down the marble staircase. All they needed now was*218*a Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room, butthere was nobody around.\"Any ideas?\" muttered Harry.\"The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there,\" saidRon, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons. The words had barelyleft his mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from theentrance.\"Excuse me,\" said Ron, hurrying up to her. \"We've forgotten the wayto our common room.\"\"I beg your pardon?\" said the girl stiffly. \"Our common room? I'm aRavenclaw.\"She walked away, looking suspiciously back at them.Harry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, theirfootsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe's and Goyle's hugefeet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn't going to be as easy as theyhad hoped.The labyrinthine passages were deserted. They walked deeper anddeeper under the school, constantly checking their watches to seehow much time they had left. After a quarter of an hour, just whenthey were getting desperate, they heard a sudden movement ahead.\"Ha!\" said Ron excitedly. \"There's one of them now!\"187The figure was emerging from a side room. As they hurried nearer,however, their hearts sank. It wasn't a Slytherin, it was Percy.\"What're you doing down here?\" said Ron in surprise.Percy looked affronted.\"That,\" he said stiffly, \"is none of your business. It's Crabbe, isn't it?\"2 19\"Wh - oh, yeah,\" said Ron.\"Well, get off to your dormitories,\" said Percy sternly. \"It's not safe togo wandering around dark corridors these days.\"\"You are,\" Ron pointed out.\"I,\" said Percy, drawing himself up, \"am a prefect. Nothing's about toattack me.\"A voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron. Draco Malfoy wasstrolling toward them, and for the first time in his life, Harry waspleased to see him.\"There you are,\" he drawled, looking at them. \"Have you two beenpigging out in the Great Hall all this time? I've been looking for you; Iwant to show you something really funny.\"Malfoy glanced witheringly at Percy.\"And what're you doing down here, Weasley?\" he sneered.Percy looked outraged.\"You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect!\" he said. \"Idon't like your attitude!\"Malfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to follow him. Harryalmost said something apologetic to Percy but caught himself just intime. He and Ron hurried after Malfoy, who said as they turned into188the next passage, \"That Peter Weasley -\"\"Percy,\" Ron corrected him automatically.\"Whatever,\" said Malfoy. \"I've noticed him sneaking around a lotlately. And I bet I know what he's up to. He thinks he's going to catchSlytherin's heir single-handed.\"He gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron exchanged excitedlooks.Malfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall.* 220 *\"What's the new password again?\" he said to Harry.\"Er -\" said Harry.\"Oh, yeah -pure-blood!\" said Malfoy, not listening, and a stone doorconcealed in the wall slid open. Malfoy marched through it, andHarry and Ron followed him.The Slytherin common room was a long, low underground roomwith rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lampswere hanging on chains. A fire was crackling under an elaboratelycarved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several Slytherins weresilhouetted around it in high-backed chairs.\"Wait here,\" said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning them to a pairof empty chairs set back from the fire. \"I'll go and get it my father'sjust sent it to me -\"Wondering what Malfoy was going to show them, Harry and Ronsat down, doing their best to look at home.Malfoy came back a minute later, holding what looked like anewspaper clipping. He thrust it under Ron's nose.\"That'll give you a laugh,\" he said.Harry saw Ron's eyes widen in shock. He read the clipping quickly,189gave a very forced laugh, and handed it to Harry.It had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet, and it said:INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGICArthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office,was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car.Mr. Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraftand Wizardry, where the221enchanted car crashed earlier this year, called today for Mr.Weasley's resignation.\"Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute,\" Mr. Malfoy told ourreporter. \"He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculousMuggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately.\"Mr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, although his wife toldreporters to clear off or she'd set the family ghoul on them.\"Well?\" said Malfoy impatiently as Harry handed the clipping back tohim. \"Don't you think it's funny?\"\"Ha, ha,\" said Harry bleakly.\"Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand inhalf and go and join them,\" said Malfoy scornfully. \"You'd never knowthe Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave.\"Ron's - or rather, Crabbe's - face was contorted with fury.\"What's up with you, Crabbe?\" snapped Malfoy.\"Stomachache,\" Ron grunted.\"Well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kickfrom me,\" said Malfoy, snickering. \"You know, I'm surprised the DailyProphet hasn't reported all these attacks yet,\" he went on thoughtfully.190\"I suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush it all up. He'll be sacked if itdoesn't stop soon. Father's always said old Dumbledore's the worstthing that's ever happened to this place. He loves Muggle-borns. Adecent headmaster would never've let slime like that Creevey in.\"*222*Malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did acruel but accurate impression of Colin: \"`Potter, can I have yourpicture, Potter? Can I have your autograph? Can I lick your shoes,please, Potter?\"'He dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron.\"What's the matter with you two?\"Far too late, Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh, but Malfoyseemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow onthe uptake.\"Saint Potter, the Mudbloods' friend,\" said Malfoy slowly. \"He'sanother one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn't go aroundwith that jumped up Granger Mudblood. And people think he'sSlytherin's heir!\"Harry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was surely secondsaway from telling them it was him - but then\"I wish I knew who it is,\" said Malfoy petulantly. \"I could help them.\"Ron's jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless thanusual. Fortunately, Malfoy didn't notice, and Harry, thinking fast,said, \"You must have some idea who's behind it all ......\"You know I haven't, Goyle, how many times do I have to tell you?\"snapped Malfoy. \"And Father won't tell me anything about the lasttime the Chamber was opened either. Of course, it was fifty yearsago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he saysthat it was all kept quiet and it'll look suspicious if I know too muchabout it. But I know one thing - last time the Chamber of Secretswas opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it's a matter of time beforeone of them's killed this time .... I hope it's Granger,\" he said with191relish.Ron was clenching Crabbe's gigantic fists. Feeling that it would be abit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy, Harry shot him a warninglook and said, \"D'you know if the person who opened the Chamberlast time was caught?\"\"Oh, yeah ... whoever it was was expelled,\" said Malfoy. \"They'reprobably still in Azkaban.\"\"Azkaban?\" said Harry, puzzled.\"Azkaban - the wizard prison, Goyle,\" said Malfoy, looking at him indisbelief \"Honestly, if you were any slower, you'd be goingbackward.\"He shifted restlessly in his chair and said, \"Father says to keep myhead down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it. He says theschool needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixedup in it. Of course, he's got a lot on his plate at the moment. Youknow the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week?\"Harry tried to force Goyle's dull face into a look of concern.\"Yeah. . .\" said Malfoy. \"Luckily, they didn't find much. Father's gotsome very valuable Dark Arts stuff. But luckily, we've got our ownsecret chamber under the drawing-room floor-\"\"Ho!\" said Ron.Malfoy looked at him. So did Harry. Ron blushed. Even his hair wasturning red. His nose was also slowly lengthening - their hour wasup, Ron was turning back into himself, and from the look of horrorhe was suddenly giving Harry, he must be, too.They both jumped to their feet.\"Medicine for my stomach,\" Ron grunted, and without further adothey sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room, hurledthemselves at the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping192against hope that Malfoy hadn't noticed anything. Harry224could feel his feet slipping around in Goyle's huge shoes and had tohoist up his robes as he shrank; they crashed up the steps into the darkentrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming from thecloset where they'd locked Crabbe and Goyle. Leaving their shoesoutside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks up the marblestaircase toward Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.\"Well, it wasn't a complete waste of time,\" Ron panted, closing thebathroom door behind them. \"I know we still haven't found out who'sdoing the attacks, but I'm going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell himto check under the Malfoys' drawing room.\"Harry checked his face in the cracked mirror. He was back to normal.He put his glasses on as Ron hammered on the door of Hermione'sstall.\"Hermione, come out, we've got loads to tell you -\"\"Go away!\" Hermione squeaked.Harry and Ron looked at each other.\"What's the matter?\" said Ron. \"You must be back to normal by now,we areBut Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door. Harry hadnever seen her looking so happy.\"Ooooooh, wait till you see,\" she said. \"It's awful-\"They heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged, sobbing, herrobes pulled up over her head.\"What's up?\" said Ron uncertainly. \"Have you still got Millicent's noseor something?\"Hermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink.193Her face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had turned yellow andthere were long, pointed ears poking through her hair.\"It was a c-cat hair!\" she howled. \"M-Millicent Bulstrode*225*m-must have a cat! And the p-potion isn't supposed to be used foranimal transformations!\"\"Uh-oh,\" said Ron.\"You'll be teased something dreadful,\" said Myrtle happily.\"It's okay, Hermione,\" said Harry quickly. \"We'll take you up to thehospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questions ......It took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom.Moaning Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw. \"Waittill everyone finds out you've got a tail!\"ermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks. There was aflurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the schoolarrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of courseeveryone thought that she had been attacked. So many students filedpast the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that MadamPomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them aroundHermione's bed, to spare her the shame of being seen with a furryface.Harry and Ron went to visit her every evening. When the new termstarted, they brought her each day's homework.\"If Id sprouted whiskers, Id take a break from work,\" said Ron, tippinga stack of books onto Hermione's bedside table one evening.\"Don't be silly, Ron, I've got to keep up,\" said Hermione briskly. Herspirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had* \"21 *194gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown.\"I don't suppose you've got any new leads?\" she added in a whisper,so that Madam Pomfrey couldn't hear her.\"Nothing,\" said Harry gloomily.\"I was so sure it was Malfoy,\" said Ron, for about the hundredth time.\"What's that?\" asked Harry, pointing to something gold sticking outfrom under Hermione's pillow.\"Just a get well card,\" said Hermione hastily, trying to poke it out ofsight, but Ron was too quick for her. He pulled it out, flicked it open,and read aloud:\"To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concernedteacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class,Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winnerof Witch Weekly's Most- Charming-Smile Award. \"Ron looked up at Hermione, disgusted.\"You sleep with this under your pillow?\"But Hermione was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweepingover with her evening dose of medicine.\"Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you've ever met, or what?\" Ronsaid to Harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairstoward Gryffindor Tower. Snape had given them so muchhomework, Harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year beforehe finished it. Ron was just saying he wished he had asked Hermionehow many rat tails you were supposed to add to a HairRaisingPotion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached theirears.\"That's Filch,\" Harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs andpaused, out of sight, listening hard.* 228*195\"You don't think someone else's been attacked?\" said Ron tensely.They stood still, their heads inclined toward Flich's voice, whichsounded quite hysterical.`= even more work for me! Mopping all night, like I haven't got enough todo! No, this is the final straw, I'm going to Dumbledore -\"His footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor and they heard adistant door slam.They poked their heads around the corner. Filch had clearly beenmanning his usual lookout post: They were once again on the spotwhere Mrs. Norris had been attacked. They saw at a glance whatFilch had been shouting about. A great flood of water stretched overhalf the corridor, and it looked as though it was still seeping fromunder the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Now that Filch hadstopped shouting, they could hear Myrtle's wails echoing off thebathroom walls.\"Now what's up with her?\" said Ron.\"Let's go and see,\" said Harry, and holding their robes over theirankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the doorbearing its OUT OF ORDER sign, ignored it as always, and entered.Moaning Myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and harder than everbefore. She seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet. It was dark inthe bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the greatrush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet.\"What's up, Myrtle?\" said Harry.\"Who's that?\" glugged Myrtle miserably. \"Come to throw somethingelse at me?\"Harry waded across to her stall and said, \"Why would I throwsomething at you?\"*229*\"Don't ask me,\" Myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave of yet more196water, which splashed onto the already sopping floor. \"Here I am,minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw abook at me ......\"But it can't hurt you if someone throws something at you,\" saidHarry, reasonably. \"I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn'tit?\"He had said the wrong thing. Myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked,\"Let's all throw books at Myrtle, because she can't feel it! Ten pointsif you can get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes throughher head! Well, ha, ha, ha! What a lovely game, I don't think!\"\"Who threw it at you, anyway?\" asked Harry.\"I don't know... I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking aboutdeath, and it fell right through the top of my head,\" said Myrtle,glaring at them. \"It's over there, it got washed out ......Harry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing. Asmall, thin book lay there. It had a shabby black cover and was aswet as everything else in the bathroom. Harry stepped forward topick it up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back.\"What?\" said Harry.\"Are you crazy?\" said Ron. \"It could be dangerous.\"\"Dangerous?\"said Harry, laughing. \"Come off it, how could it bedangerous?\"\"You'd be surprised,\" said Ron, who was looking apprehensively atthe book. \"Some of the books the Ministry's confiscated Dad's toldme - there was one that burned your eyes out. And*2%0*everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the restof their lives. And some old witch in Bath had a book that you couldnever stop reading! You just had to wander around with your nose in it,trying to do everything one-handed. And -\"197\"All right, I've got the point,\" said Harry.The little book lay on the floor, nondescript and soggy.\"Well, we won't find out unless we look at it,\" he said, and he duckedaround Ron and picked it up off the floor.Harry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the covertold him it was fifty years old. He opened it eagerly. On the first pagehe could just make out the name \"T M. Riddle\" in smudged ink.\"Hang on,\" said Ron, who had approached cautiously and was lookingover Harry's shoulder. \"I know that name .... T. M. Riddle got anaward for special services to the school fifty years ago.\"\"How on earth d'you know that?\" said Harry in amazement.\"Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times indetention,\" said Ron resentfully. \"That was the one I burped slugs allover. If you'd wiped slime off a name for an hour, you'd remember it,too.\"Harry peeled the wet pages apart. They were completely blank.There wasn't the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not evenAuntie Mabel's birthday, or dentist, half-past three.\"He never wrote in it,\" said Harry, disappointed.\"I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?\" said Ron curiously.Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed nameof a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London.*231 *\"He must've been Muggle-born,\" said Harry thoughtfufly. \"To havebought a diary from Vauxhall Road ......\"Well, it's not much use to you,\" said Ron. He dropped his voice. \"Fiftypoints if you can get it through Myrtle's nose.\"Harry, however, pocketed it.198Hermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-less, and furfree, atthe beginning of February. On her first evening back in GryffindorTower, Harry showed her T. M. Riddle's diary and told her the storyof how they had found it.\"Oooh, it might have hidden powers,\" said Hermione enthusiastically,taking the diary and looking at it closely.\"If it has, it's hiding them very well,\" said Ron. \"Maybe it's shy. I don'tknow why you don't chuck it, Harry.\"\"I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,\" said Harry. \"Iwouldn't mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special servicesto Hogwarts either.\"\"Could've been anything,\" said Ron. \"Maybe he got thirty O.WL.s orsaved a teacher from the giant squid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; thatwould've done everyone a favor .....But Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione's face thatshe was thinking what he was thinking.\"What?\" said Ron, looking from one to the other.\"Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn't it?\"he said. \"That's what Malfoy said.\"\"Yeah. . .\" said Ron slowly.\"And this diary is fifty years old,\" said Hermione, tapping it excitedly.*232*a so?.\"Oh, Ron, wake up,\" snapped Hermione. \"We know the person whoopened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago. We knowT. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty yearsago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of199Slytherin? His diary would probably tell us everything - where theChamber is, and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it -the person who's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want that lyingaround, would they?\"\"That's a brilliant theory, Hermione,\" said Ron, \"with just one tiny littleflaw. There's nothing written in his diary.\"But Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag.\"It might be invisible ink!\" she whispered.She tapped the diary three times and said, \"Aparecium!\"Nothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back intoher bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser.\"It's a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,\" she said.She rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened.\"I'm telling you, there's nothing to find in there,\" said Ron. \"Riddle justgot a diary for Christmas and couldn't be bothered filling it in.\"Harry couldn't explain, even to himself, why he didn't just throwRiddle's diary away. The fact was that even though he knew the diarywas blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages,as though it were a story he wanted to finish. And while Harry wassure he had never heard the name T. M. Riddle before, it still seemedto mean something to him, almost as though* 233 *Riddle was a friend he'd had when he was very small, and hadhalfforgotten. But this was absurd. He'd never had friends beforeHogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that.Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, sonext day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle'sspecial award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and athoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he'd seen enough of thetrophy room to last him a lifetime.200Riddle's burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet. Itdidn't carry details of why it had been given to him (\"Good thing, too,or it'd be even bigger and Id still be polishing it,\" said Ron). However,they did find Riddle's name on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and ona list of old Head Boys.\"He sounds like Percy,\" said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust.\"Prefect, Head Boy ... probably top of every class -\"\"You say that like it's a bad thing,\" said Hermione in a slightly hurtvoice.The sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again. Insidethe castle, the mood had grown more hopeful. There had been nomore attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, andMadam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes werebecoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leavingchildhood.\"The moment their acne clears up, they'll be ready for repotting again,\"Harry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon. \"And after that, itwon't be long until we're cutting them up and stewing them. You'llhave Mrs. Norris back in no time.\"* 243 *Perhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought Harry.It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets,with the school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster,whatever it was, was even now settling itself down to hibernate foranother fifty years ....Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn't take this cheerful view. He wasstill convinced that Harry was the guilty one, that he had \"givenhimself away\" at the Dueling Club. Peeves wasn't helping matters; hekept popping up in the crowded corridors singing \"Oh, Potter, yourotter . . .\" now with a dance routine to match.Gilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacksstop. Harry overheard him telling Professor McGonagall so while theGryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration.201\"I don't think there'll be any more trouble, Minerva,\" he said, tappinghis nose knowingly and winking. \"I think the Chamber has been lockedfor good this time. The culprit must have known it was only a matterof time before I caught him. Rather sensible to stop now, before Icame down hard on him.\"You know, what the school needs now is a morale-booster. Washaway the memories of last term! I won't say any more just now, but Ithink I know just the thing . . . .\"He tapped his nose again and strode off.Lockhart's idea of a morale-booster became clear at breakfast time onFebruary fourteenth. Harry hadn't had much sleep because of a laterunningQuidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down tothe Great Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a moment, that he'dwalked through the wrong doors.The walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers. Worse* 235*still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Harrywent over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting lookingsickened, and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles.\"What's going on?\" Harry asked them, sitting down and wiping confettioff his bacon.Ron pointed to the teachers' table, apparently too disgusted to speak.Lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, waswaving for silence. The teachers on either side of him were lookingstony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could see a muscle going inProfessor McGonagall's cheek. Snape looked as though someone hadjust fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro.\"Happy Valentine's Day!\" Lockhart shouted. \"And may I thank theforty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken theliberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it doesn't endhere!\"202Lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hallmarched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however.Lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps.\"My friendly, card-carrying cupids!\" beamed Lockhart. \"They will beroving around the school today delivering your valentines! And the fundoesn't stop here! I'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into thespirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you howto whip up a Love Potion! And while you're at it, Professor Flitwickknows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I'veever met, the sly old dog!\"Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was look* 236ing as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would beforce-fed poison.\"Please, Hermione, tell me you weren't one of the forty-six, 51 said Ronas they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenlybecame very interested in searching her bag for her schedule anddidn't answer.All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to delivervalentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon asthe Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfscaught up with Harry.\"Oy, you! 'Arty Potter!\" shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf,elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry.Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a lineof first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry triedto escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd bykicking people's shins, and reached him before he'd gone two paces.\"I've got a musical message to deliver to 'Arry Potter in person,\" hesaid, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way.\"Not here,\" Harry hissed, trying to escape.203\"Stay still!\" grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Harry's bag and pullinghim back.\"Let me go!\" Harry snarled, tugging.With a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His books, wand,parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashedover everything.Harry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarfstarted singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor.*237*\"What's going on here?\" came the cold, drawling voice of DracoMalfoy. Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his rippedbag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musicalvalentine.\"What's all this commotion?\" said another familiar voice as PercyWeasley arrived.Losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarfseized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor.\"Right,\" he said, sitting on Harry's ankles. \"Here is your singingvalentine:His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,His hair is as dark as a blackboard.I wish he was mine, he's really divine,The hero who conquered the Dark LordHarry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on thespot. Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, hisfeet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did hisbest to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth.\"Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class,now,\" he said, shooing some of the younger students away. \"And you,Malfoy-\"204Harry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something.Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and Harry realized thathe'd got Riddle's diary.\"Give that back,\" said Harry quietly.\"Wonder what Potter's written in this?\" said Malfoy, who obvi* 238ously hadn't noticed the year on the cover and thought he hadHarry's own diary. A hush fell over the onlookers. Ginny was staringfrom the diary to Harry, looking terrified.\"Hand it over, Malfoy,\" said Percy sternly.\"When I've had a look,\" said Malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly atHarry.Percy said, \"As a school prefect -\" but Harry had lost his temper. Hepulled out his wand and shouted, \"Expelliarmus!\" and just asSnape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shootingout of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it.\"Harry!\" said Percy loudly. \"No magic in the corridors. I'll have toreport this, you know!\"But Harry didn't care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worthfive points from Gryffindor any day. Malfoy was looking furious, andas Ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully afterher, \"I don't think Potter liked your valentine much!\"Ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class. Snarling,Ron pulled out his wand, too, but Harry pulled him away. Ron didn'tneed to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs.It wasn't until they had reached Professor Flitwick's class that Harrynoticed something rather odd about Riddle's diary. All his otherbooks were drenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was asclean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. Hetried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his205wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end,and he wasn't much interested in anything else.Harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. Thiswas partly because he didn't think he could stand Fred and Georgesinging, \"His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad\" one more time,and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle's diary again, andknew that Ron thought he was wasting his time.Harry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, notone of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a newbottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped ablot onto the first page of the diary.The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though itwas being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded uphis quill a second time and wrote, \"My name is Harry Potter.\"The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank withouttrace. Then, at last, something happened.Oozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harryhad never written.\"Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come by mydiary?\"These words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started toscribble back.\"Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.\"He waited eagerly for Riddle's reply.\"Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink.But I always knew that there would be those who would not want thisdiary read. \"\"What do you mean?\" Harry scrawled, blotting the page in hisexcitement.*240*206`I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that werecovered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft andWizardry. \"\"That's where I am now,\" Harry wrote quickly. \"I'm at Hogwarts, andhorrible stuff's been happening. Do you know anything about theChamber of Secrets?\"His heart was hammering. Riddle's reply came quickly, his writingbecoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew.\"Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us itwas a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, theChamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finallykilling one. I caught the person whod opened the Chamber and he wasexpelled. But the Headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thinghad happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was givenout that thegirl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny,engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But Iknew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had thepower to release it was not imprisoned. \"Harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back.\"It's happening again now. There have been three attacks and no oneseems to know who's behind them. Who was it last time?\"\"I can show you, if you like, \"came Riddle's reply. \"You don't haveto take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the nightwhen I caught him. \"Harry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddlemean? How could he be taken inside somebody else's memory? Heglanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was*241*growing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh wordsforming.207\"Let me show you. \"Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters.(40K.55The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind,stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open,Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to haveturned into a miniscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly,he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, andbefore he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; thewindow was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he waspitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of colorand shadow.He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurredshapes around him came suddenly into focus.He knew immediately where he was. This circular room with thesleeping portraits was Dumbledore's office - but it wasn't Dumbledorewho was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, fraillooking wizard, baldexcept for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter bycandlelight. Harry had never seen this man before.\"I'm sorry,\" he said shakily. \"I didn't mean to butt in -\"But the wizard didn't look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly.Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, \"Er - I'll just go, shallI?\"Still the wizard ignored him. He didn't seem even to have heard him.Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice.*242*\"Sorry I disturbed you. I'll go now,\" he half-shouted.The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked pastHarry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at hiswindow.208The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset.The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs,watching the door.Harry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix - no whirringsilver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it,meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not Dumbledore,and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible tothe people of fifty years ago.There was a knock on the office door.\"Enter,\" said the old wizard in a feeble voice.A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silverprefect's badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller thanHarry, but he, too, had jet-black hair.\"Ah, Riddle,\" said the Headmaster.\"You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?\" said Riddle. He lookednervous.\"Sit down,\" said Dippet. \"I've just been reading the letter you sent me.\"Oh,\" said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together verytightly.\"My dear boy,\" said Dipper kindly, \"I cannot possibly let you stay atschool over the summer. Surely you want to go home for theholidays?\"\"No,\" said Riddle at once. \"Id much rather stay at Hogwarts than goback to that - to that -\"* 243*\"You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?\" saidDippet curiously.\"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle, reddening slightly.209\"You are Muggle-born?\"\"Half-blood, sir,\" said Riddle. \"Muggle father, witch mother.\"\"And are both your parents -?\"\"My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at theorphanage she lived just long enough to name me - Tom after myfather, Marvolo after my grandfather.\"Dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically.\"The thing is, Tom,\" he sighed, \"Special arrangements might havebeen made for you, but in the current circumstances . . . .\"\"You mean all these attacks, sir?\" said Riddle, and Harry's heartleapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything.\"Precisely,\" said the headmaster. \"My dear boy, you must see howfoolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle whenterm ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy ... the death ofthat poor little girl .... You will be safer by far at your orphanage. Asa matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking aboutclosing the school. We are no nearer locating the er - source of allthis unpleasantness . . . .\"Riddle's eyes had widened.\"Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped -\"\"What do you mean?\" said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sittingup in his chair. \"Riddle, do you mean you know something aboutthese attacks?\"\"No, sir,\" said Riddle quickly.But Harry was sure it was the same sort of \"no\" that he himself hadgiven Dumbledore.*244*Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed.210\"You may go, Tom ......Riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. Harryfollowed him.Down the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to thegargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle stopped, and so didHarry, watching him. Harry could tell that Riddle was doing someserious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.Then, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off,Harry gliding noiselessly behind him. They didn't see another personuntil they reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long,sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marblestaircase.\"What are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom?\"Harry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-yearyoungerDumbledore.\"I had to see the headmaster, sir,\" said Riddle.\"Well, hurry off to bed,\" said Dumbledore, giving Riddle exactly thekind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well. \"Best not to roam thecorridors these days. Not since . . .\"He sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off. Riddlewatched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headedstraight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hotpursuit.But to Harry's disappointment, Riddle led him not into a hiddenpassageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in whichHarry had Potions with Snape. The torches hadn't been lit, and whenRiddle pushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just*2 45 *see him, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside.211It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour. All he couldsee was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack,waiting like a statue. And just when Harry had stopped feelingexpectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present,he heard something move beyond the door.Someone was creeping along the passage. He heard whoever it waspass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden. Riddle, quiet as ashadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behindhim, forgetting that he couldn't be heard.For perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Riddlestopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises.Harry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in ahoarse whisper.\"C'mon ... gotta get yeh outta here .... C'mon now ... in the box. . .\"There was something familiar about that voice ....Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry stepped out behindhim. He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouchingin front of an open door, a very large box next to it.\"Evening, Rubeus,\" said Riddle sharply.The boy slammed the door shut and stood up.\"What yer doin' down here, Tom?\"Riddle stepped closer.\"It's all over,\" he said. \"I'm going to have to turn you in, Rubeus.They're talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don't stop.\"4 6\"N\" at d'yeh -\"\"I don't think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don't makegood pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and -\"212\"It never killed no one!\" said the large boy, backing against theclosed door. From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling andclicking.\"Come on, Rubeus,\" said Riddle, moving yet closer. \"The dead girl'sparents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is makesure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered ......\"It wasn't him!\" roared the boy, his voice echoing in the darkpassage. \"He wouldn'! He never!\"\"Stand aside,\" said Riddle, drawing out his wand.His spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door behindthe large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wallopposite. And out of it came something that made Harry let out along, piercing scream unheard by anyoneA vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam ofmany eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers - Riddle raised hiswand again, but he was too late. The thing bowled him over as itscuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddlescrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but thehuge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down,yelling, \"NO000000!\"The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himselffalling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-posterin the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle's diary lying open on his stomach.*24 7*Before he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory dooropened and Ron came in.\"There you are,\" he said.Harry sat up. He was sweating and shaking.\"What's up?\" said Ron, looking at him with concern.\"It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty213years ago.\"Harry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had anunfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During their firstyear at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little woodenhouse, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, threeheadeddog he'd christened \"Fluffy.\" And if, as a boy, Hagrid hadheard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Harry wassure he'd have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it. He'd probablythought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up solong, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs;Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to fit aleash and collar on it. But he was equally certain that Hagrid wouldnever have meant to kill anybody.Harry half wished he hadn't found out how to work Riddle's diary.Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount whathe'd seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of thelong, circular conversations that followed.\"Riddle might have got the wrong person,\" said Hermione. \"Maybe itwas some other monster that was attacking people . . . .\"\"How many monsters d'you think this place can hold?\" Ron askeddully.\"We always knew Hagrid had been expelled,\" said Harry miserably.\"And the attacks must've stopped after Hagrid was kicked out.Otherwise, Riddle wouldn't have got his award.\"Ron tried a different tack.\"Riddle does sound like Percy - who asked him to squeal on Hagrid,anyway?\"\"But the monster had killed someone, Ron,\" said Hermione.\"And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if theyclosed Hogwarts,\" said Harry. \"I don't blame him for wanting to stayhere ......214\"You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn't you, Harry?\"\"He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,\" said Harry quickly.The three of them fell silent. After a long pause, Hermione voiced theknottiest question of all in a hesitant voice.\"Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?\"\"That'd be a cheerful visit,\" said Ron. \"'Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, haveyou been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?\"'In the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Hagridunless there was another attack, and as more and more days went bywith no whisper from the disembodied voice, they becamehopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he hadbeen expelled. It was now nearly four months since Justin and NearlyHeadless Nick had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed tothink that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. Peeveshad finally got bored of his \"Oh, Potter, you rotter\" song, ErnieMacmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leapingtoadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of theMandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. Thismade Professor Sprout very happy.\"The moment they start trying to move into each other's pots, we'llknow they're fully mature,\" she told Harry. \"Then we'll be able torevive those poor people in the hospital wing.\"The second years were given something new to think about duringtheir Easter holidays. The time had come to choose their subjects forthe third year, a matter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously.\"it could affect our whole future,\" she told Harry and Ron as theypored over lists of new subjects, marking them with checks.\"I just want to give up Potions,\" said Harry.\"We can't,\" said Ron gloomily. \"We keep all our old subjects, or I'd'veditched Defense Against the Dark Arts.\"215\"But that's very important!\" said Hermione, shocked.\"Not the way Lockhart teaches it,\" said Ron. \"I haven't learnedanything from him except not to set pixies loose.\"Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches andwizards in his family, all giving him different advice on what tochoose. Confused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists withhis tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancysounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes. DeanThomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with Muggles, ended upclosing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking thesubjects it landed on. Hermione took nobody's advice but signed up foreverything.Harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Vernonand Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career inwizardry with them. Not that he didn't get any guidance: PercyWeasley was eager to share his experience.\"Depends where you want to go, Harry,\" he said. \"It's never too earlyto think about the future, so Id recommend Divination. People sayMuggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards shouldhave a thorough understanding of the non-magical community,particularly if they're thinking of working in close contact with them -look at my father, he has to deal with Muggle business all the time. Mybrother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so he went forCare of Magical Creatures. Play to your strengths, Harry.\"But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch. Inthe end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he waslousy at them, at least he'd have someone friendly to help him.Gryffindor's next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Woodwas insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Harrybarely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However,the training sessions were getting better, or at leastdrier, and the evening before Saturday's match he went up to hisdormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Gryffindor's chances forthe Quidditch cup had never been better.216But his cheerful mood didn't last long. At the top of the stairs to thedormitory, he met Neville Longbottom, who was looking frantic.\"Harry - I don't know who did it - I just found -\"Watching Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open the door.The contents of Harry's trunk had been thrown everywhere. Hiscloak lay ripped on the floor. The bedclothes had been pulled off hisfour-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedsidecabinet, the contents strewn over the mattress.Harry walked over to the bed, open-mouthed, treading on a fewloose pages of Travels with Trolls. As he and Neville pulled theblankets back onto his bed, Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in. Deanswore loudly.\"What happened, Harry?\"\"No idea,\" said Harry. But Ron was examining Harry's robes. All thepockets were hanging out.\"Someone's been looking for something,\" said Ron. \"Is there anythingmissing?\"Harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk.It was only as he threw the last of the Lockhart books back into itthat he realized what wasn't there.\"Riddle's diary's gone,\" he said in an undertone to Ron.\"What?\"Harry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Ron followedhim out. They hurried down to the Gryffindor commonroom, which was half-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sittingalone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy.Hermione looked aghast at the news.217\"But - only a Gryffindor could have stolen - nobody else knows ourpassword -\"\"Exactly,\" said Harry.They woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshingbreeze.\"Perfect Quidditch conditions!\" said Wood enthusiastically at theGryffindor table, loading the team's plates with scrambled eggs.\"Harry, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast.\"Harry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wonderingif the new owner of Riddle's diary was right in front of his eyes.Hermione had been urging him to report the robbery, but Harry didn'tlike the idea. He'd have to tell a teacher all about the diary, and howmany people knew why Hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago? Hedidn't want to be the one who brought it all up again.As he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and collect hisQuidditch things, another very serious worry was added to Harry'sgrowing list. He had just set foot on the marble staircase when heheard it yet again\"Kill this time ... let me rip ... tear. . .\"He shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both jumped away from himin alarm.\"The voice!\" said Harry, -looking over his shoulder. \"I just heard itagain - didn't you?\"Ron shook his head, wide-eyed. Hermione, however, clapped ahand to her forehead.\"Harry - I think I've just understood something! I've got to go to thelibrary!\"And she sprinted away, up the stairs.\"What does she understand?\" said Harry distractedly, still lookingaround, trying to tell where the voice had come from.218\"Loads more than I do,\" said Ron, shaking his head.\"But why's she got to go to the library?\"\"Because that's what Hermione does,\" said Ron, shrugging. \"When indoubt, go to the library.\"Harry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but peoplewere now emerging from the Great Hall behind him, talking loudly,exiting through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch.\"You'd better get moving,\" said Ron. \"It's nearly eleven - the match -\"Harry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his Nimbus TwoThousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds,but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, andas he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker. room, his only comfortwas that everyone was now outside to watch the game.The teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause. OliverWood took off for a warm-up flight around the goal posts; MadamHooch released the balls. The Hufflepuffs, who played in canaryyellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion oftactics.Harry was just mounting his broom when Professor McGonagallcame half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying anenormous purple megaphone.Harry's heart dropped like a stone.\"This match has been cancelled,\" Professor McGonagall calledthrough the megaphone, addressing the packed stadium. There wereboos and shouts. Oliver Wood, looking devastated, landed and rantoward Professor McGonagall without getting off his broomstick.\"But, Professor!\" he shouted. \"We've got to play - the cupGryffindor -\"219Professor McGonagall ignored him and continued to shout through hermegaphone:\"All students are to make their way back to the House commonrooms, where their Heads of Houses will give them furtherinformation. As quickly as you can, please!\"Then she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Harry over to her.\"Potter, I think you'd better come with me ......Wondering how she could possibly suspect him this time, Harry sawRon detach himself from the complaining crowd; he came running upto them as they set off toward the castle. To Harry's surprise,Professor McGonagall didn't object.\"Yes, perhaps you'd better come, too, Weasley .....Some of the students swarming around them were grumbling aboutthe match being canceled; others looked worried. Harry and Ronfollowed Professor McGonagall back into the school and up themarble staircase. But they weren't taken to anybody's office this time.\"This will be a bit of a shock,\" said Professor McGonagall in asurprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary. \"There hasbeen another attack ... another double attack.\"Harry's insides did a horrible somersault. Professor McGonagallpushed the door open and he and Ron entered. .Madam Pomfrey was bending over a fifth-year girl with long, curlyhair. Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they'd accidentallyasked for directions to the Slytherin common room. And on the bednext to her was\"Hermione!\" Ron groaned.Hermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy.\"They were found near the library,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Idon't suppose either of you can explain this? It was on the floor nextto them ......220She was holding up a small, circular mirror.Harry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at Hermione.\"I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,\" said ProfessorMcGonagall heavily. \"I need to address the students in any case.\"All students will return to their House common rooms by six o'clockin the evening. No student is to leave the dormitories after that time.You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No student is to usethe bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. All further Quidditchtraining and matches are to be postponed. There will be no moreevening activities.\"The Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to ProfessorMcGonagall in silence. She rolled up the parchmentfrom which she had been reading and said in a somewhat chokedvoice, \"I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed. It islikely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind theseattacks is caught. I would urge anyone who thinks they might knowanything about them to come forward.\"She climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and theGryffindors began talking immediately.\"That's two Gryffindors down, not counting a Gryffindor ghost, oneRavenclaw, and one Hufflepuff, \" said the Weasley twins' friend LeeJordan, counting on his fingers. \"Haven't any of the teachers noticedthat the Slytherins are all safe? Isn't it obvious all this stuff's comingfrom Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of Slytherin - whydon't they just chuck all the Slytherins out?\" he roared, to nods andscattered applause.Percy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but for once he didn'tseem keen to make his views heard. He was looking pale and stunned.\"Percy's in shock,\" George told Harry quietly. \"That Ravenclaw girl -Penelope Clearwater - she's a prefect. I don't think he thought themonster would dare attack a prefect.\"221But Harry was only half-listening. He didn't seem to be able to get ridof the picture of Hermione, lying on the hospital bed as though carvedout of stone. And if the culprit wasn't caught soon, he was looking at alifetime back with the Dursleys. Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid inbecause he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if theschool closed. Harry now knew exactly how he had felt.\"What're we going to do?\" said Ron quietly in Harry's ear. \"D'youthink they suspect Hagrid?\"\"We've got to go and talk to him,\" said Harry, making up hismind. \"I can't believe it's him this time, but if he set the monsterloose last time he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets,and that's a start.\"\"But McGonagall said we've got to stay in our tower unless we'rein class -\"\"I think,\" said Harry, more quietly still, \"it's time to get my dad'sold cloak out again.\"Harry had inherited) ust one thing from his father: a long and silvery Invisibility Cloak. It was their only chance of sneaking out ofthe school to visit Hagrid without anyone knowing about it. Theywent to bed at the usual time, waited until Neville, Dean, and Seamus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finallyfallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the cloak overthemselves.The journey through the dark and deserted castle corridorswasn't enjoyable. Harry, who had wandered the castle at night several times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset. Teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs,staring around for any unusual activity. Their Invisibility Cloakdidn't stop them making any noise, and there was a particularlytense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spotwhere Snape stood standing guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed atalmost exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with relief that theyreached the oak front doors and eased them open.It was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the lit windowsof Hagrid's house and pulled off the cloak only when they wereright outside his front door.Seconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open. They foundthemselves face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at them. Fang222the boarhound barked loudly behind him.\"Oh,\" he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them. \"What'reyou two doin' here?\"\"What's that for?\" said Harry, pointing at the crossbow as theystepped inside.\"Nothin' - nothin' - \" Hagrid muttered. \"I've bin expectin' doesn'matter - Sit down - I'll make tea -\"He hardly seemed to know what he was doing. He nearlyextinguished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and thensmashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand.\"Are you okay, Hagrid?\" said Harry. \"Did you hear aboutHermione?\"\"Oh, I heard, all righ',\" said Hagrid, a slight break in his voice.He kept glancing nervously at the windows. He poured them bothlarge mugs of boiling water (he had forgotten to add tea bags) andwas just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loudknock on the door.Hagrid dropped the fruitcake. Harry and Ron exchangedpanicstricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back overthemselves and retreated into a corner. Hagrid checked that theywere hidden, seized his crossbow, and flung open his door oncemore.\"Good evening, Hagrid.\"It was Dumbledore. He entered, looking deadly serious, and wasfollowed by a second, very odd-looking man.The stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, andwas wearing a strange mixture of clothes: a pinstriped suit, ascarlet tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots. Under his armhe carried a lime-green bowler.223\"That's Dad's boss!\" Ron breathed. \"Cornelius Fudge, the Minister ofMagic!\"Harry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up.Hagrid had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into one of his chairsand looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge.\"Bad business, Hagrid,\" said Fudge in rather clipped tones. \"Very badbusiness. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things've gonefar enough. Ministry's got to act.\"\"I never,\" said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore. \"You know Inever, Professor Dumbledore, sir -\"\"I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence,\"said Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge.\"Look, Albus,\" said Fudge, uncomfortably. \"Hagrid's record's againsthim. Ministry's got to do something - the school governors have beenin touch -\"\"Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not helpin the slightest,\" said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were full of a fireHarry had never seen before.\"Look at it from my point of view,\" said Fudge, fidgeting with hisbowler. \"I'm under a lot of pressure. Got to be seen to be doingsomething. If it turns out it wasn't Hagrid, he'll be back and no moresaid. But I've got to take him. Got to. Wouldn't be doing my duty -\"\"Take me?\" said Hagrid, who was trembling. \"Take me where?\"\"For a short stretch only,\" said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid's eyes. \"Nota punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution. If someone else is caught,you'll be let out with a full apology -\"\"Not Azkaban?\" croaked Hagrid.Before Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door.224Dumbledore answered it. It was Harry's turn for an elbow in the ribs;he'd let out an audible gasp.Mr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid's hut, swathed in a long blacktraveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile. Fang started togrowl.\"Already here, Fudge,\" he said approvingly. \"Good, good. . .\"\"What're you doin' here?\" said Hagrid furiously. \"Get outta my house!\"\"My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in beinginside your - er - d'you call this a house?\" said Lucius Malfoy, sneeringas he looked around the small cabin. \"I simply called at the school andwas told that the headmaster was here.\"\"And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?\" said Dumbledore.He spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes.\"Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,\" said Malfoy lazily, taking out a long rollof parchment, \"but the governors feel it's time for you to step aside.This is an Order of Suspension - you'll find all twelve signatures on it.I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch. How many attacks havethere been now? Two more this afternoon, wasn't it? At this rate,there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know whatan awful loss that would be to the school.\"\"Oh, now, see here, Lucius,\" said Fudge, looking alarmed,\"Dumbledore suspended - no, no - last thing we want just now262\"The appointment - or suspension - of the headmaster is a matter forthe governors, Fudge,\" said Mr. Malfoy smoothly. \"And asDumbledore has failed to stop these attacks -\"\"See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can't stop them,\" said Fudge, whoseupper lip was sweating now, \"I mean to say, who can?\"\"That remains to be seen,\" said Mr. Malfoy with a nasty smile. \"But asall twelve of us have voted -\"225Hagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling.'An' how many did yeh have ter threaten an' blackmail before theyagreed, Malfoy, eh?\" he roared.\"Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into troubleone of these days, Hagrid,\" said Mr. Malfoy. \"I would advise you notto shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won't like it at all.\"\"Yeh can' take Dumbledore!\" yelled Hagrid, making Fang theboarhound cower and whimper in his basket. \"Take him away, an' theMuggle-borns won' stand a chance! There'll be killin' next!\"\"Calm yourself, Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore sharply. He looked atLucius Malfoy.\"If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside-\"\"But -\" stuttered Fudge.\"No!\"growled Hagrid.Dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Malfoy'scold gray ones.\"However,\" said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so thatnone of them could miss a word, \"you will find that I will* 26$*ummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lakealike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst intobloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the castlewindows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn'tlook right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle,where things were so horribly wrong.Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were nowbarred from the hospital wing.226\"We're taking no more chances,\" Madam Pomfrey told them severelythrough a crack in the infirmary door. \"No, I'm sorry, there's everychance the attacker might come back to finish these people off . . .\"With Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that thesun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullionedwindows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school* 265*that didn't look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang throughthe corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled.Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore's final words to himself \"I willonly truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me... Help willalways be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\" But what goodwere these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help,when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were?Hagrid's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand thetrouble was, there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle tofollow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly)by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren'tallowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castlein a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow studentsseemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class byteachers, but Harry found it very irksome.One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying theatmosphere of terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was struttingaround the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy.Harry didn't realize what he was so pleased about until the Potionslesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left, when,sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbeand Goyle.\"I always thought Father might be the one who got rid ofDumbledore,\" he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. \"I told youhe thinks Dumbledore's the worst headmaster the school's ever227*266*had. Maybe we'll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won'twant the Chamber of Secrets closed. McGonagall won't last long,she's only filling in ......Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione'sempty seat and cauldron.\"Sir,\" said Malfoy loudly. \"Sir, why don't you apply for theheadmaster's job?\"\"Now, now, Malfoy,\" said Snape, though he couldn't suppress a thinlippedsmile. \"Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by thegovernors. I daresay he'll be back with us soon enough.\"\"Yeah, right,\" said Malfoy, smirking. \"I expect you'd have Father'svote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job - I'll tell Father you're thebest teacher here, sir -\"Snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately notspotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into hiscauldron.\"I'm quite surprised the Mudbloods haven't all packed their bags bynow,\" Malfoy went on. \"Bet you five Galleons the next one dies. Pityit wasn't Granger -\"The bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Malfoy's lastwords, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bagsand books, his attempts to reach Malfoy went unnoticed.\"Let me at him,\" Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms.\"I don't care, I don't need my wand, I'm going to kill him with my barehands -\"\"Hurry up, I've got to take you all to Herbology,\" barked Snape overthe class's heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and Deanbringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only* 261*228safe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle andthey were making their way across the vegetable patch toward thegreenhouses.The Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missingfrom their number, Justin and Hermione.Professor Sprout set them all to work pruning the AbyssinianShrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto thecompost heap and found himself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan.Ernie took a deep breath and said, very formally, \"I just want to say,Harry, that I'm sorry I ever suspected you. I know you'd never attackHermione Granger, and I apologize for all the stuff I said. We're all inthe same boat now, and, well -\"He held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it.Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig asHarry and Ron.\"That Draco Malfoy character,\" said Ernie, breaking off dead twigs,\"he seems very pleased about all this, doesn't he? D'you know, I thinkhe might be Slytherin's heir.\"\"That's clever of you,\" said Ron, who didn't seem to have forgivenErnie as readily as Harry.\"Do you think it's Malfoy, Harry?\" Ernie asked.\"No,\" said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared.A second later, Harry spotted something.Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other sideof the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking theshortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit Ron over the handwith his pruning shears.\"Ouch! What're you -\"268229Harry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyesscrewed up against the sun.\"Oh, yeah,\" said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased. \"But we can'tfollow them now -\"Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously.Harry's eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If they pursuedtheir fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they wouldend up.\"Looks like they're heading for the Forbidden Forest . . . .\"And Ron looked even unhappier about that.At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to theirDefense Against the Dark Arts lesson. Harry and Ron lagged behindthe others so they could talk out of earshot.\"We'll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,\" Harry told Ron. \"Wecan take Fang with us. He's used to going into the forest with Hagrid,he might be some help.\"\"Right,\" said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers.\"Er - aren't there - aren't there supposed to be werewolves in theforest?\" he added as they took their usual places at the back ofLockhart's classroom.Preferring not to answer that question, Harry said, \"There are goodthings in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns ...Ron had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. Harry hadentered it only once and had hoped never to do so again.Lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him. Everyother teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, butLockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant.2 69\"Come now,\" he cried, beaming around him. \"Why all these long230faces?\"People swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered.\"Don't you people realize,\" said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as thoughthey were all a bit dim, \"the danger has passed! The culprit has beentaken away -\"\"Says who?\" said Dean Thomas loudly.\"My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn't have takenHagrid if he hadn't been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty,\"said Lockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that one and onemade two.\"Oh, yes he would,\" said Ron, even more loudly than Dean.\"I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid's arrest than youdo, Mr. Weasley,\" said Lockhart in a self-satisfied tone.Ron started to say that he didn't think so, somehow, but stopped inmidsentence when Harry kicked him hard under the desk.\"We weren't there, remember?\" Harry muttered.But Lockhart's disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had alwaysthought Hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole businesswas now at an end, irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throwGadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart's stupid face. Instead hecontented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: Let's do it tonight.Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at theempty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen hisresolve, and he nodded.The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days,because from six o'clock onward the Gryffindors had no -*270*where else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the resultthat the common room often didn't empty until past midnight.231Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right afterdinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room toclear. Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games ofExploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very subdued inHermione's usual chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, tryingto finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnightwhen Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed.Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doorsclosing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, andclimbing through the portrait hole.It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all theteachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock onthe oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop anycreaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds.\"'Course,\" said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass,\"we might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow. Thosespiders might not've been going there at all. I know it looked like theywere moving in that sort of general direction, but. . .\"His voice trailed away hopefully.They reached Hagrid's house, sad and sorry-looking with its blankwindows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joyat the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castlewith his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle fudge froma tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together.Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid's table. There would be noneed for it in the pitch-dark forest.* 21:L *\"C'mon, Fang, we're going for a walk,\" said Harry, patting his leg, andFang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to theedge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.Harry took out his wand, murmured, \"Lumos!\" and a tiny lightappeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for232signs of spiders.\"Good thinking,\" said Ron. \"Id light mine, too, but you know - it'dprobably blow up or something ......Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitaryspiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of thetrees.\"Okay,\" Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, \"I'm ready. Let'sgo.\"So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves,they entered the forest. By the glow of Harry's wand, they followedthe steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walkedbehind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard fornoises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when thetrees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead wereno longer visible, and Harry's wand shone alone in the sea of dark,they saw their spider guides leaving the path.Harry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, buteverything outside his little sphere of *light was pitch-black. He hadnever been this deep into the forest before. He could vividlyremember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last timehe'd been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting ina cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders.* 2-V2 *Something wet touched Harry's hand and he jumped backward,crushing Rods foot, but it was only Fang's nose.\"What d'you reckon?\" Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could justmake out, reflecting the light from his wand.\"We've come this far,\" said Ron.So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees.They couldn't move very quickly now; there were tree roots andstumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. Harry couldfeel Fang's hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop,233so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight.They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robessnagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, theynoticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though thetrees were as thick as ever.Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harryand Ron jump out of their skins.\"What?\" said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, andgripping Harry's elbow very hard.\"There's something moving over there,\" Harry breathed. \"Listen ...sounds like something big ......They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big wassnapping branches as it carved a path through the trees.\"Oh, no,\" said Ron. \"Oh, no, oh, no, oh -\"\"Shut up,\" said Harry frantically. \"It'll hear you.\"\"Hear me?\" said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. \"It's already heardFang!\"The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they* 273*stood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and thensilence.\"What d'you think it's doing?\" said Harry.\"Probably getting ready to pounce,\" said Ron.They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move.\"D'you think it's gone?\" Harry whispered.\"Dunno -\"234Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in thedarkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes.Fang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns andyelped even louder.\"Harry!\" Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief \"Harry, it's ourcar!\"\"What?\"\"Come on!\"Harry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping,and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing.Mr. Weasley's car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle ofthick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze. AsRon walked, open-mouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him,exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner.\"It's been here all the time!\" said Ron delightedly, walking around thecar. \"Look at it. The forest's turned it wild . . . .\"The sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud.Apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own.Fang didn't seem at all keen on it; he kept close to Harry, who couldfeel him quivering. His breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffedhis wand back into his robes.*214*\"And we thought it was going to attack us!\" said Ron, leaning againstthe car and patting it. \"I wondered where it had gone!\"Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders,but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights.\"We've lost the trail,\" he said. \"C'mon, let's go and find them.\"Ron didn't speak. He didn't move. His eyes were fixed on a pointsome ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry. His face was235livid with terror.Harry didn't even have time to turn around. There was a loud clickingnoise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him aroundthe middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hangingfacedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron'slegs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling - nextmoment, he was being swept away into the dark trees.Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching onsix immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly belowa pair of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could hear another ofthe creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were moving into the veryheart of the forest. Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself froma third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn't have yelled even ifhe had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the carin the clearing.He never knew how long he was in the creature's clutches; he onlyknew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that theleaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his necksideways, he realized that they had reached the ridge of*21$*a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the starsshone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on.Spiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below.Spiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy,gigantic. The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its waydown the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center ofthe hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, clicking theirpincers excitedly at the sight of its load.Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ronand Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn't howling anymore,but cowering silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt.His mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyeswere popping.Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was236saying something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked hispincers with every word he spoke.\"Aragog!\" it called. \"Aragog!\"And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of asmall elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black ofhis body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head wasmilky white. He was blind.\"What is it?\" he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.\"Men,\" clicked the spider who had caught Harry.\"Is it Hagrid?\" said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyeswandering vaguely.\"Strangers,\" clicked the spider who had brought Ron.\"Kill them,\" clicked Aragog fretfully. \"I was sleeping ......\"We're friends of Hagrid's,\" Harry shouted. His heart seemed to haveleft his chest to pound in his throat.*216*Click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow.Aragog paused.\"Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,\" he said slowly.\"Hagrid's in trouble,\" said Harry, breathing very fast. \"That's whywe've come.\"\"In trouble?\" said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concernbeneath the clicking pincers. \"But why has he sent you?\"Harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it; he didn'tthink his legs would support him. So he spoke from the ground, ascalmly as he could.237\"They think,, up at the school, that Hagrid's been setting a a -something on students. They've taken him to Azkaban.\"Aragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow thesound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause,except applause didn't usually make Harry feel sick with fear.\"But that was years ago,\" said Aragog fretfully. \"Years and years ago.I remember it well. That's why they made him leave the school. Theybelieved that I was the monster that dwells in what they call theChamber of Secrets. They thought that Hagrid had opened theChamber and set me free.\"\"And you ... you didn't come from the Chamber of Secrets?\" saidHarry, who could feel cold sweat on his forehead.\"I!\" said Aragog, clicking angrily. \"I was not born in the castle. I comefrom a distant land. A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg.Hagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard inthe castle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Hagrid2Yis my good friend, and a good man. When I was discovered, andblamed for the death of a girl, he protected me. I have lived here inthe forest ever since, where Hagrid still visits me. He even found mea wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all throughHagrid's goodness ......Harry summoned what remained of his courage.\"So you never - never attacked anyone?\"\"Never,\" croaked the old spider. \"It would have been my instinct, butout of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human. The body of thegirl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom. I never saw anypart of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. Our kind likethe dark and the quiet ......\"But then ... Do you know what did kill that girl?\" said Harry.\"Because whatever it is, it's back and attacking people again -\"238His words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and therustling of many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shiftedall around him.\"The thing that lives in the castle,\" said Aragog, \"is an ancient creaturewe spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleadedwith Hagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about theschool.\"\"What is it?\" said Harry urgently.More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.\"We do not speak of it!\" said Aragog fiercely. \"We do not name it! Inever even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though heasked me, many times.\"Harry didn't want to press the subject, not with the spiders* 2-V8 *pressing closer on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of tamng. Hewas backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiderscontinued to inch slowly toward Harry and Ron.\"We'll just go, then,\" Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearingleaves rustling behind him.\"Go?\" said Aragog slowly. \"I think not ......\"But - but -\"\"My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But Icannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into ourmidst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid.\"Harry spun around. Feet away, towering above him, was a solid wallof spiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads.Even as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was no good, therewere too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die fighting,a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the239hollow.Mr. Weasley's car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring,its horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown ontotheir backs, their endless legs waving in the air. The car screeched toa halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew open.\"Get Fang!\" Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized theboarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back ofthe car - the doors slammed shut - Ron didn't touch the acceleratorbut the car didn't need him; the engine roared and they were off,hitting more spiders. They sped up the slope, out of the hollow, andthey were soon crashing through the forest, brancheswhipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through thewidest gaps, following a path it obviously knew.Harry looked sideways at Ron. His mouth was still open in the silentscream, but his eyes weren't popping anymore.\"Are you okay?\"Ron stared straight ahead, unable to speak.They smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudlyin the back seat, and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as theysqueezed past a large oak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the treesthinned, and Harry could again see patches of sky.The car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into thewindshield. They had reached the edge of the forest. Fang flunghimself at the window in his anxiety to get out, and when Harryopened the door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid's house, tailbetween his legs. Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ronseemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still stiff-neckedand staring. Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back intothe forest and disappeared from view.Harry went back into Hagrid's cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak. Fangwas trembling under a blanket in his basket. When Harry got outsideagain, he found Ron being violently sick in the pumpkin patch.240\"Follow the spiders,\" said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his sleeve.\"I'll never forgive Hagrid. We're lucky to be alive.\"\"I bet he thought Aragog wouldn't hurt friends of his,\" said Harry.\"That's exactly Hagrid's problem!\" said Ron, thumping the wall of thecabin. \"He always thinks monsters aren't as bad as they're*280*made out, and look where it's got him! A cell in Azkaban!\" He wasshivering uncontrollably now. \"What was the point of sending us inthere? What have we found out, Id like to know?\"\"That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Harry,throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to make himwalk. \"He was innocent.\"Ron gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboardwasn't his idea of being innocent.As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make suretheir feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar.They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up themarble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors wherewatchful sentries were walking. At last they reached the safety of theGryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself intoglowing ash. They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair totheir dormitory.Ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry,however, didn't feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his fourposter,thinking hard about everything Aragog had said.The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought,sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort - even other monsters didn'twant to name it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what itwas, or how it Petrified its victims. Even Hagrid had never knownwhat was in the Chamber of Secrets.Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against hispillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window.241He couldn't see what else they could do. They had hit dead ends*281*everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir ofSlytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the sameperson, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time.There was nobody else to ask. Harry lay down, still thinking aboutwhat Aragog had said.He was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very lasthope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright.\"Ron,\" he hissed through the dark, \"Ron -\"Ron woke with a yelp like Fang's, stared wildly around, and sawHarry.\"Ron -that girl who died. Aragog said she was found in a bathroom,\"said Harry, ignoring Neville's snufing snores from the corner. \"Whatif she never left the bathroom? What if she's still there?\"Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And then heunderstood, too.\"You don't think - not Moaning Myrtle?\"A ll those times we were in that bathroom, and she was justthree toilets away,\" said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day,\"and we could've asked her, and now. . .\"It had been hard enough trying to look for spiders. Escaping theirteachers long enough to sneak into a girls' bathroom, the girls' bathroom,moreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was going to bealmost impossible.But something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration, that drovethe Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks.Ten minutes into the class, Professor McGonagall told them that theirexams would start on the first of June, one week from today.242`Exams?\" howled Seamus Finnigan. \"We're still getting exams?\"There was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville Longbottom's wandslipped, vanishing one of the legs on his desk. Professorr*28%*McGonagall restored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned,frowning, to Seamus.\"The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you toreceive your education,\" she said sternly. \"The exams will thereforetake place as usual, and I trust you are all studying hard.\"Studying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that there would beexams with the castle in this state. There was a great deal of mutinousmuttering around the room, which made Professor McGonagall scowleven more darkly.\"Professor Dumbledore's instructions were to keep the school runningas normally as possible, she said. \"And that, I need hardly point out,means finding out how much you have learned this year.Harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to beturning into slippers. What had he learned so far this year? He couldn'tseem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam.Ron looked as though he'd just been told he had to go and live in theForbidden Forest.\"Can you imagine me taking exams with this?\" he asked Harry, holdingup his wand, which had just started whistling loudly.Three days before their first exam, Professor McGonagall madeanother announcement at breakfast.\"I have good news,\" she said, and the Great Hall, instead of fallingsilent, erupted.243\"Dumbledore's coming back!\" several people yelled joyfully.\"You've caught the Heir of Slytherin!\" squealed a girl at theRavenclaw table.284*\"Quidditch matches are back on!\" roared Wood excitedly.When the hubbub had subsided, Professor McGonagall said,\"Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready forcutting at last. Tonight, we will be able to revive those people whohave been Petrified. I need hardly remind you all that one of them maywell be able to tell us who, or what, attacked them. I am hopeful thatthis dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit.\"There was an explosion of cheering. Harry looked over at theSlytherin table and wasn't at all surprised to see that Draco Malfoyhadn't joined in. Ron, however, was looking happier than he'd looked indays.\"It won't matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!\" he said to Harry.\"Hermione'll probably have all the answers when they wake her up!Mind you, she'll go crazy when she finds out we've got exams in threedays' time. She hasn't studied. It might be kinder to leave her whereshe is till they're over.\"Just then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron. Shelooked tense and nervous, and Harry noticed that her hands weretwisting in her lap.\"What's up?\" said Ron, helping himself to more porridge.Ginny didn't say anything, but glanced up and down the Gryffindortable with a scared look on her face that reminded Harry of someone,though he couldn't think who.\"Spit it out,\" said Ron, watching her.Harry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She was rockingbackward and forward slightly in her chair, exactly like Dobby didwhen he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information.244\"I've got to tell you something,\" Ginny mumbled, carefully not looking atHarry.\"What is it?\" said Harry.Ginny looked as though she couldn't find the right words.\"What?\"said Ron.Ginny opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Harry leanedforward and spoke quietly, so that only Ginny and Ron could hear him.\"Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have you seensomething? Someone acting oddly?\"Ginny drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, Percy Weasleyappeared, looking tired and wan.\"If you've finished eating, I'll take that seat, Ginny. I'm starving, I'veonly just come off patrol duty.\"Ginny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified, gavePercy a fleeting, frightened look, and scampered away. Percy satdown and grabbed a mug from the center of the table.\"Percy!\" said Ron angrily. \"She was just about to tell us some-' thingimportant!\"Halfway through a gulp of tea, Percy choked.\"What sort of thing?\" he said, coughing.\"I just asked her if she'd seen anything odd, and she started to say\"Oh - that - that's nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets,\" saidPercy at once.\"How do you know?\" said Ron, his eyebrows raised.\"Well, er, if you must know, Ginny, er, walked in on me the other daywhen I was - well, never mind - the point is, she spot245ted me doing something and I, um, I asked her not to mention it toanybody. I must say, I did think she'd keep her word. It's nothing,really, Id just rather -\"Harry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable.\"What were you doing, Percy?\" said Ron, grinning. \"Go on, tell us, wewon't laugh.\"Percy didn't smile back.\"Pass me those rolls, Harry, I'm starving.\"Harry knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow withouttheir help, but he wasn't about to pass up a chance to speak to Myrtleif it turned up - and to his delight it did, midmorning, when they werebeing led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart.Lockhart, who had so often assured them that all danger had passed,only to be proved wrong right away, was now wholeheartedlyconvinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safelydown the corridors. His hair wasn't as sleek as usual; it seemed hehad been up most of the night, patrolling the fourth floor.\"Mark my words,\" he said, ushering them around a corner. \"The firstwords out of those poor Petrified people's mouths will be It wasHagrid.' Frankly, I'm astounded Professor McGonagall thinks allthese security measures are necessary.\"(ti agree, sir,\" said Harry, making Ron drop his books in surprise.\"Thank you, Harry, said Lockhart graciously while they waited for along line of Hufflepuffs to pass. \"I mean, we teachers have quiteenough to be getting on with, without walking students to classes andstanding guard all night ......\"That's right,\" said Ron, catching on. \"Why don't you leave us here, sir,we've only got one more corridor to go -\"\"You know, Weasley, I think I will,\" said Lockhart. \"I really should goand prepare my next class -\"246And he hurried off.\"Prepare his class,\" Ron sneered after him. \"Gone to curl his hair,more like.\"They let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of them, then darteddown a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Myrtle'sbathroom. But just as they were congratulating each other on theirbrilliant scheme\"Potter! Weasley! What are you doing?\"It was Professor McGonagall, and her mouth was the thinnest of thinlines.\"We were -we were-\" Ron stammered. \"We were going to - to go andsee -\"\"Hermione,\" said Harry. Ron and Professor McGonagall both lookedat him.\"We haven't seen her for ages, Professor,\" Harry went on hurriedly,treading on Ron's foot, \"and we thought we'd sneak into the hospitalwing, you know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er,not to worry -\"Professor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for a moment,Harry thought she was going to explode, but when she spoke, it was ina strangely croaky voice.\"Of course,\" she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in herbeady eye. \"Of course, I realize this has all been hardest on the friendsof those who have been ... I quite understand. Yes,Potter, of course you may visit Miss Granger. I will inform ProfessorBinns where you've gone. Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given mypermission.\"Harry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that they'davoided detention. As they turned the corner, they distinctly heardProfessor McGonagall blow her nose.247\"That,\" said Ron fervently, \"was the best story you've ever come upwith.\"They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell MadamPomfrey that they had Professor McGonagall's permission to visitHermione.Madam Pomfrey let them in, but reluctantly.\"There's just no point talking to a Petrified. person,\" she said, and theyhad to admit she had a point when they'd taken their seats next toHermione. It was plain that Hermione didn't have the faintest inklingthat she had visitors, and that they might just as well tell her bedsidecabinet not to worry for all the good it would do.\"Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?\" said Ron, looking sadlyat Hermione's rigid face. \"Because if he sneaked up on them all, noone'll ever know . .....But Harry wasn't looking at Hermione's face. He was more interestedin her right hand. It lay clenched on top of her blankets, and bendingcloser, he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside her fist.Making sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near, he pointed thisout to Ron.\"TG and get it out,\" Ron whispered, shifting his chair so that heblocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey's view.It was no easy task. Hermione's hand was clamped so tightly aroundthe paper that Harry was sure he was going to tear it. While Ron keptwatch he tugged and twisted, and at last, after several tense minutes,the paper came free.It was a page torn from a very old library book. Harry smoothed it outeagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too.Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land,there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk,known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which mayreach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born248from a chicken's egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing aremost wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basiliskhas a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shallsuffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortalenemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which isfatal to it.And beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand Harryrecognized as Hermione's. Pipes.It was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain.\"Ron,\" he breathed. \"This is it. This is the answer. The monster in theChamber's a basilisk - a giant serpent! That why I've been hearingthat voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it. It's becauseI understand Parseltongue . . . .\"Harry looked up at the beds around him.\"The basilisk kills people by looking at them. But no one's died -because no one looked it straight in the eye. Colin saw it through hiscamera. The basilisk burned up all the film inside it, but Colin just gotPetrified. Justin . . . Justin must've seen the basilisk through NearlyHeadless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he couldn't die again .. . and Hermione and that Ravenclaw prefect were found with amirror next to them. Hermione had just realized the monster was abasilisk. I bet you anything she warned the first person she met tolook around corners with a mirror first! And that girl pulled out hermirror - and -\"Rods jaw had dropped.\"And Mrs. Norris?\" he whispered eagerly.Harry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night of Halloween.\"The water. . .\" he said slowly. \"The flood from Moaning Myrtle'sbathroom. I bet you Mrs. Norris only saw the reflection . . . .\"He scanned the page in his hand eagerly. The more he looked at it,the more it made sense.249`: . . The crowing of the rooster . . . is fatal to it\"! he read aloud. \"Hagrid'sroosters were killed! The Heir of Slytherin didn't want one anywherenear the castle once the Chamber was opened! Spidersflee before it.! Itall fits!\"\"But how's the basilisk been getting around the place?\" said Ron. \"Agiant snake . . . Someone would've seen. . .\"Harry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had scribbled at thefoot of the page.\"Pipes,\" he said. \"Pipes . . . Ron, it's been using the plumbing. I'vebeen hearing that voice inside the walls . . . .\"291*Ron suddenly grabbed Harry's arm.\"The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!\" he said hoarsely.\"What if it's a bathroom? What if it's in -\"`= Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, \"said Harry.They sat there, excitement coursing through them, hardly ableto believe it.\"This means,\" said Harry, \"I can't be the only Parselmouth inthe school. The Heir of Slytherin's one, too. That's how he's beencontrolling the basilisk.\"\"What're we going to do?\" said Ron, whose eyes were flashing.\"Should we go straight to McGonagall?\"\"Let's go to the staff room,\" said Harry, jumping up. \"She'll bethere in ten minutes. It's nearly break.\"They ran downstairs. Not wanting to be discovered hangingaround in another corridor, they went straight into the desertedstaff room. It was a large, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs.Harry and Ron paced around it, too excited to sit down.But the bell to signal break never came.Instead, echoing through the corridors came Professor McGonagall's voice, magically magnified.`All students to return to their House dormitories at once. All teachers return to the staff room. Immediately, please. \"Harry wheeled around to stare at Ron.\"Not another attack? Not now?\"250\"What'll we do?\" said Ron, aghast. \"Go back to the dormitory?\"\"No,\" said Harry, glancing around. There was an ugly sort ofwardrobe to his left, full of the teachers' cloaks. \"In here. Let's hearwhat it's all about. Then we can tell them what we've found out.\"They hid themselves inside it, listening to the rumbling of hundreds ofpeople moving overhead, and the staff room door banging open.From between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched theteachers filtering into the room. Some of them were looking puzzled,others downright scared. Then Professor McGonagall arrived.\"It has happened,\" she told the silent staff room. \"A student has beentaken by the monster. Right into the Chamber itself.\"Professor Flitwick let out a squeal. Professor Sprout clapped herhands over her mouth. Snape gripped the back of a chair very hardand said, \"How can you be sure?\"\"The Heir of Slytherin,\" said Professor McGonagall, who was verywhite, \"left another message. Right underneath the first one. `Herskeleton will lie in the Chamber forever. \"'Professor Flitwick burst into tears.\"Who is it?\" said Madam Hooch, who had sunk, weak-kneed, into achair. \"Which student?\"\"Ginny Weasley,\" said Professor McGonagall.Harry felt Ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor besidehim.\"We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow,\" saidProfessor McGonagall. \"This is the end of Hogwarts. Dumbledorealways said. . .\"The staffroom door banged open again. For one wild moment,Harry was sure it would be Dumbledore. But it was Lockhart, andhe was beaming.\"So sorry - dozed off - what have I missed?\"251He didn't seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at himwith something remarkably like hatred. Snape stepped forward.\"Just the man,\" he said. \"The very man. A girl has been snatched bythe monster, Lockhart. Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself. Yourmoment has come at last.\"Lockhart blanched.\"That's right, Gilderoy,\" chipped in Professor Sprout. \"Weren't yousaying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance tothe Chamber of Secrets is?\"\"I - well, I -\"sputtered Lockhart.\"Yes, didn't you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?\"piped up Professor Flitwick.\"D-did I? I don't recall -\"\"I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn't had acrack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested,\" said Snape. \"Didn'tyou say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you shouldhave been given a free rein from the first?\"Lockhart stared around at his stony-faced colleagues.\"I - I really never - you may have misunderstood -\"\"We'll leave it to you, then, Gilderoy,\" said Professor McGonagall.\"Tonight will be an excellent time to do it. We'll make sure everyone'sout of your way. You'll be able to tackle the monster all by youself. Afree rein at last.\"Lockhart gazed desperately around him, but nobody came to therescue. He didn't look remotely handsome anymore. His lip wastrembling, and in the absence of his usually toothy grin, he lookedweak-chinned and feeble.\"V very well,\" he said. \"I'll - I'll be in my office, getting getting ready.\"And he left the room.252\"Right,\" said Professor McGonagall, whose nostrils were flared,\"that's got him out from under our feet. The Heads of Houses shouldgo and inform their students what has happened. Tell them theHogwarts Express will take them home first thing tomorrow. Will therest of you please make sure no students have been left outside theirdormitories.\"The teachers rose and left, one by one.It was probably the worst day of Harry's entire life. He, Ron, Fred,and George sat together in a corner of the Gryffindor common room,unable to say anything to each other. Percy wasn't there. He had goneto send an owl to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then shut himself up in hisdormitory.No afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had GryffindorTower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet. Near sunset, Fred andGeorge went up to bed, unable to sit there any longer.\"She knew something, Harry,\" said Ron, speaking for the first timesince they had entered the wardrobe in the staff room. \"That's whyshe was taken. It wasn't some stupid thing about Percy at all., She'dfound out something about the Chamber of Secrets. That must be whyshe was -\" Ron rubbed his eyes frantically. \"I mean, she was a pureblood.There can't be any other reason.\"Harry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline. This wasthe worst he had ever felt. If only there was something they could do.Anything.\"Harry\" said Ron. \"D'you think there's any chance at all she's not - youknow =\"Harry didn't know what to say. He couldn't see how Ginny could stillbe alive.\"D'you know what?\" said Ron. \"I think we should go and see*295*253Lockhart. Tell him what we know. He's going to try and get into theChamber. We can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it's abasilisk in there.\"Because Harry couldn't think of anything else to do, and because hewanted to be doing something, he agreed. The Gryffindors aroundthem were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, thatnobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room, and leftthrough the portrait hole.Darkness was falling as they walked down to Lockhart's office.There seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it. They could hearscraping, thumps, and hurried footsteps.Harry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside. Then thedoor opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of Lockhart's eyespeering through it.\"Oh - Mr. Potter - Mr. Weasley -\" he said, opening the door a bitwider. \"I'm rather busy at the moment - if you would be quick -\"\"Professor, we've got some information for you,\" said Harry. \"Wethink it'll help you.\"\"Er - well - it's not terribly -\" The side of Lockhart's face that theycould see looked very uncomfortable. \"I mean - well all right -\"He opened the door and they entered.His office had been almost completely stripped. Two large trunksstood open on the floor. Robes, jade-green, lilac, midnightblue, hadbeen hastily folded into one of them; books were jumbled untidily intothe other. The photographs that had covered the walls were nowcrammed into boxes on the desk.*296*\"Are you going somewhere?\" said Harry.\"Er, well, yes,\" said Lockhart, ripping a life-size poster of himself fromthe back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up. \"Urgent call -unavoidable - got to go -\"254\"What about my sister?\" said Ron jerkily.\"Well, as to that - most unfortunate -\" said Lockhart, avoiding theireyes as he wrenched open a drawer and started emptying the contentsinto a bag. \"No one regrets more than I -\"\"You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!\" said Harry.\"You can't go now! Not with all the Dark stuff going on here!\"\"Well - I must say - when I took the job -\" Lockhart muttered, nowpiling socks on top of his robes. \"nothing in the job description - didn'texpect -\"\"You mean you're running away?\" said Harry disbelievingly. \"After allthat stuff you did in your books -\"\"Books can be misleading,\" said Lockhart delicately.\"You wrote them!\" Harry shouted.\"My dear boy,\" said Lockhart, straightening up and frowning at Harry.\"Do use your common sense. My books wouldn't have sold half aswell if people didn't think Id done all those things. No one wants toread about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save avillage from werewolves. He'd look dreadful on the front cover. Nodress sense at all. And the witch who banished the Bandon Bansheehad a harelip. I mean, come on -\"\"So you've just been taking credit for what a load of other people havedone?\" said Harry incredulously.\"Harry, Harry,\" said Lockhart, shaking his head impatiently, \"it's notnearly as simple as that. There was work involved. I had*297*to track these people down. Ask them exactly how they managed todo what they did. Then I had to put a Memory Charm on them so theywouldn't remember doing it. If there's one thing I pride myself on, it'smy Memory Charms. No, it's been a lot of work, Harry. It's not allbook signings and publicity photos, you know. You want fame, you255have to be prepared for a long hard slog.\"He banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them.\"Let's see,\" he said. \"I think that's everything. Yes. Only one thingleft.\"He pulled out his wand and turned to them.\"Awfully sorry, boys, but I'll have to put a Memory Charm on younow. Can't have you blabbing my secrets all over the place. Id neversell another book -\"Harry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had barely raised his,when Harry bellowed, \"Expelliarmus!\"Lockhart was blasted backward, falling over his trunk; his wand flewhigh into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.\"Shouldn't have let Professor Snape teach us that one,\" said Harryfuriously, kicking Lockhart's trunk aside. Lockhart was looking up athim, feeble once more. Harry was still pointing his wand at him.\"What d'you want me to do?\" said Lockhart weakly. \"I don't knowwhere the Chamber of Secrets is. There's nothing I can do.\"\"You're in luck,\" said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint.\"We think we know where it is. And what's inside it. Let's go.\"*298*They marched Lockhart out of his office and down the nearest stairs,along the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall, to thedoor of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.They sent Lockhart in first. Harry was pleased to see that he wasshaking.Moaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet.\"Oh, it's you,\" she said when she saw Harry. \"What do you want thistime?\"256\"To ask you how you died,\" said Harry.Myrtle's whole aspect changed at once. She looked as though she hadnever been asked such a flattering question.\"Ooooh, it was dreadful,\" she said with relish. \"It happened right inhere. I died in this very stall. I remember it so well. Id hidden becauseOlive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. The door was locked,and I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in. They saidsomething funny. A different language, I think it must have been.Anyway, what really got me was that it was a boy speaking. So Iunlocked the door, to tell him to go and use his own toilet, and then -\"Myrtle swelled importantly, her face shining. \"I died.\"\"How?\" said Harry.\"No idea,\" said Myrtle in hushed tones. \"I just remember seeing a paircame back again. I was determined to haunt Olive Hornby, you see.Oh, she was sorry she'd ever laughed at my glasses.\"\"Where exactly did you see the eyes?\" said Harry.*299*\"Somewhere there,\" said Myrtle, pointing vaguely toward the sink infront of her toilet.Harry and Ron hurried over to it. Lockhart was standing well back, alook of utter terror on his face.It looked like an ordinary sink. They examined every inch of it, insideand out, including the pipes below. And then Harry saw it: Scratchedon the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake.\"That tap's never worked,\" said Myrtle brightly as he tried to turn it.\"Harry,\" said Ron. \"Say something. Something in Parseltongue.\"\"But -\" Harry thought hard. The only times he'd ever managed to257speak Parseltongue were when he'd been faced with a real snake. Hestared hard at the tiny- engraving, trying to imagine it was real.\"Open up,\" he said.He looked at Ron, who shook his head.\"English,\" he said.Harry looked back at the snake, willing himself to believe it was alive.If he moved his head, the candlelight made it look as though it weremoving.\"Open up,\" he said.Except that the words weren't what he heard; a strange hissing hadescaped him, and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light andbegan to spin. Next second, the sink began to move; the sink, in fact,sank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a pipe wideenough for a man to slide into.Harry heard Ron gasp and looked up again. He had made up his mindwhat he was going to do.*300*\"I'm going down there,\" he said. .He couldn't not go, not now they had found the entrance to theChamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest chancethat Ginny might be alive.\"Me too,\" said Ron.There was a pause.\"Well, you hardly seem to need me,\" said Lockhart, with a shadowof his old smile. \"I'll just -\"He put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both pointedtheir wands at him.258\"You can go first,\" Ron snarled.White-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening.\"Boys,\" he said, his voice feeble. \"Boys, what good will it do?\"Harry jabbed him in the back with his wand. Lockhart slid his legsinto the pipe.\"I really don't think -\" he started to say, but Ron gave him a push,and he slid out of sight. Harry followed quickly. He lowered himselfslowly into the pipe, then let go.It was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. He could seemore pipes branching off in all directions, but none as large as theirs,which twisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and he knewthat he was falling deeper below the school than even the dungeons.Behind him he could hear Ron, thudding slightly at the curves.And then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happenwhen he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of theend with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnellarge enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting to his*301feet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. Harrystood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too.\"We must be miles under the school,\" said Harry, his voice echoing inthe black tunnel.\"Under the lake, probably,\" said Ron, squinting around at the dark,slimy walls.All three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead.\"Lumos!\" Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. \"C'mon,\" hesaid to Ron and Lockhart, and off they went, their footsteps slappingloudly on the wet floor.The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead.259Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight.\"Remember,\" Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward,\"any sign of movement, close your eyes right away . .....But the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected soundthey heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to bea rat's skull. Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw thatit was littered with small animal bones. Trying very hard not toimagine what Ginny might look like if they found her, Harry led theway forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel.\"Harry - there's something up there -\" said Ron hoarsely, grabbingHarry's shoulder.They froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of somethinghuge and curved, lying right across the tunnel. It wasn't moving.\"Maybe it's asleep,\" he breathed, glancing back at the other two.Lockhart's hands were pressed over his eyes. Harry turned back tolook at the thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt.* 302 *Very slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still see,Harry edged forward, his wand held high.The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green,lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor. The creature that hadshed it must have been twenty feet long at least.\"Blimey,\" said Ron weakly.There was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy Lockhart'sknees had given way.\"Get up,\" said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart.Lockhart got to his feet - then he dived at Ron, knocking him to theground.Harry jumped forward, but too late - Lockhart was straightening up,260panting, Ron's wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on hisface.\"The adventure ends here, boys!\" he said. \"I shall take a bit of thisskin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl,and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of hermangled body - say good-bye to your memories!\"He raised Ron's Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled,\"Obliviate!\"The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. Harry flung hisarms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, outof the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering tothe floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at a solid wallof broken rock.\"Ron!\" he shouted. \"Are you okay? Ron!\"\"I'm here!\" came Ron's muffled voice from behind the rockfall. \"I'mokay - this git's not, though - he got blasted by the wand ='*303*There was a dull thud and a loud \"ow!\" It sounded as though Ron hadjust kicked Lockhart in the shins.\"What now?\" Ron's voice said, sounding desperate. \"We can't getthrough - it'll take ages ......Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had appeared in it.He had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks bymagic, and now didn't seem a good moment to try - what if the wholetunnel caved in?There was another thud and another \"ow!\" from behind the rocks.They were wasting time. Ginny had already been in the Chamber ofSecrets for hours .... Harry knew there was only one thing to do.\"Wait there,\" he called to Ron. \"Wait with Lockhart. I'll go on.... If I'mnot back in an hour. . .261There was a very pregnant pause,\"I'll try and shift some of this rock,\" said Ron, who seemed to be tryingto keep his voice steady. \"So you can - can get back through. And,Harry -\"\"See you in a bit,\" said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into hisshaking voice.And he set off alone past the giant snake skin.Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone.The tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry's body wastingling unpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet dreaded whathe'd find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept around yet anotherbend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents werecarved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds.*304*Harry approached, his throat very dry. There was no need to pretendthese stone snakes were real; their eyes looked strangely alive.He could guess what he had to do. He cleared his throat, and theemerald eyes seemed to flicker.\"Open, \"said Harry, in a low, faint hiss.The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothlyout of sight, and Harry, shaking from head to foot, walked inside.e was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber. Toweringstone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support aceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd,greenish gloom that filled the place.His heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence.Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? Andwhere was Ginny?He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentinecolumns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls.262He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallestsign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakesseemed to be following him. More than once, with a jolt of thestomach, he thought he saw one stir.Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as theChamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall.*306*Harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: Itwas ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost tothe bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes, where twoenormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And betweenthe feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-redhair.\"tinny!\" Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his knees.\"tinny - don't be dead - please don't be dead -\" He flung his wandaside, grabbed Ginny's shoulders, and turned her over. Her face waswhite as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn'tPetrified. But then she must be\"Ginny, please wake up,\" Harry muttered desperately, shaking her.Ginny's head lolled hopelessly from side to side.\"She won't wake,\" said a soft voice.Harry jumped and spun around on his knees.A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar,watching. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as thoughHarry were looking at him through a misted window. But there wasno mistaking him\"Tom - Tom Riddle?\"Riddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry's face.\"What d'you mean, she won't wake?\" Harry said desperately. \"She's263not - she's not -?\"\"She's still alive,\" said Riddle. \"But only just.\"Harry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty yearsago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a dayolder than sixteen.\"Are you a ghost?\" Harry said uncertainly.* 30 7*\"A memory,\" said Riddle quietly. \"Preserved in a diary for fifty years.He pointed toward the floor near the statue's giant toes. Lying openthere was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle'sbathroom. For a second, Harry wondered how it had got there - butthere were more pressing matters to deal with.\"You've got to help me, Tom,\" Harry said, raising Ginny's head again.\"We've got to get her out of here. There's a basilisk ... I don't knowwhere it is, but it could be along any moment .... Please, help me -1)Riddle didn't move. Harry, sweating, managed to hoist Ginny half offthe floor, and bent to pick up his wand again.But his wand had gone.\"Did you see -?\"He looked up. Riddle was still watching him - twirling Harry's wandbetween his long fingers.\"Thanks,\" said Harry, stretching out his hand for it.A smile curled the corners of Riddle's mouth. He continued to stare atHarry, twirling the wand idly.\"Listen,\" said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny's deadweight. \"We've got to go! If the basilisk comes -\"\"It won't come until it is called,\" said Riddle calmly.264Harry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up anylonger.\"What d'you mean?\" he said. \"Look, give me my wand, I might need it-\"Riddle's smile broadened.\"You won't be needing it,\" he said.*%08*Harry stared at him.\"What d'you mean, I won't be -?\"\"I've waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle. \"For thechance to see you. To speak to you.\"\"Look,\" said Harry, losing patience, \"I don't think you get it. We're inthe Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later -\"\"We're going to talk now,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and hepocketed Harry's wand.Harry stared at him. There was something very funny going on here....\"How did Ginny get like this?\" he asked slowly.\"Well, that's an interesting question,\" said Riddle pleasantly. \"And quitea long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley's like this isbecause she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisiblestranger.\"\"What are you talking about?\" said Harry.\"The diary,\" said Riddle. `My diary. Little Ginny's been writing in it formonths and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes - howher brothers tease her, how she had to come to school withsecondhand robes and books, how\" -Riddle's eyes glinted \"how she265didn't think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like her . . . .\"All the time he spoke, Riddle's eyes never left Harry's face. Therewas an almost hungry look in them.\"It's very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an elevenyear-old girl,\" he went on. \"But I was patient. I wrote back. I wassympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one's everunderstood me like you, Tom .... I'm so glad I've got this diary to*309*confide in .... It's like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket . . . .Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn't suit him. It made the hairsstand up on the back of Harry's neck.\"If I say it myself, Harry, I've always been able to charm the people Ineeded. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened tobe exactly what I wanted .... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet ofher deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far morepowerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feedingMiss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soulback into her. . .\"\"What d'you mean?\" said Harry, whose mouth had gone very dry.\" Haven't you guessed yet, Harry Potter?\" said Riddle softly. \"GinnyWeasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the schoolroosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set theSerpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib's cat.\"No,\" Harry whispered.\"Yes,\" said Riddle, calmly. \"Of course, she didn't know what she wasdoing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen hernew diary entries ... far more interesting, they became .... Dear Tom,\"he recited, watching Harry's horrified face, `I think I'm losing mymemory. There are rooster feathers all over my robes and 1 don't know howthey got there. Dear Tom, l can't remember what 1 did on the night ofHalloween, but a cat was attacked and I've got paint all down my front.Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I'm pale and I'm not myself. I think he266suspects me... There was another attack today*310and I don't know where I was. Tom, what am I going to do? I think I'mgoing mad... I think I'm the one attacking everyone, Tom!\"Harry's fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into his Palms.\"it took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting herdiary,\" said Riddle. \"But she finally became suspicious and tried todispose of it. And that's where you came in, Harry. You found it, and Icouldn't have been more delighted. Of all the people who could havepicked it up, it was you, the very person I was most anxious to meet . .. .\"\"And why did you want to meet me?\" said Harry. Anger was coursingthrough him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady.\"Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry,\" said Riddle. \"Yourwhole fascinating history. \" His eyes roved over the lightning scar onHarry's forehead, and their expression grew hungrier. \"I knew I mustfind out more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decidedto show you my famous capture of that great oaf, Hagrid, to gain yourtrust -\"\"Hagrid's my friend,\" said Harry, his voice now shaking. \"And youframed him, didn't you? I thought you made a mistake, but -\"Riddle laughed his high laugh again.\"It was my word against Hagrid's, Harry. Well, you can imagine howit looked to old Armando Dippet. On the one hand, Tom Riddle, poorbut brilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student ...on the other hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in trouble every other week,trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed, sneaking off to theForbidden Forest to wrestle trolls ... but I* 31:L *admit, even I was surprised how well the plan worked. I thoughtsomeone must realize that Hagrid couldn't possibly be the Heir of267Slytherin. It had taken me five whole years to find out everything Icould about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance... as though Hagrid had the brains, or the power!\"Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to thinkHagrid was innocent. He persuaded Dipper to keep Hagrid and trainhim as gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed ....Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachersdid ......\"I bet Dumbledore saw right through you,\" said Harry, his teeth gritted.\"Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagridwas expelled,\" said Riddle carelessly. \"I knew it wouldn't be safe toopen the Chamber again while I was still at school. But I wasn't goingto waste those long years Id spent searching for it. I decided to leavebehind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so thatone day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, andfinish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.\"\"Well, you haven't finished it,\" said Harry triumphantly. \"No one's diedthis time, not even the cat. In a few hours the Mandrake Draught willbe ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again -\"\"Haven't I already told you,\" said Riddle quietly, \"that killing Mudbloodsdoesn't matter to me anymore? For many months now, my new targethas been -you.\"Harry stared at him.\"Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was*312*opened, it was Ginny who was writing to me, not you. She saw youwith the diary, you see, and panicked. \"What if you found out how towork it, and I repeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, Itold you who'd been strangling roosters? So the foolish little brat waiteduntil your dormitory was deserted and stole it back. But I knew what Imust do. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin'sheir. From everything Ginny had told me about you, I knew you wouldgo to any lengths to solve the mystery --268particularly if one of your best friends was attacked. And Ginny hadtold me the whole school was buzzing because you could speakParseltongue ....\"So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come downhere to wait. She struggled and cried and became very boring. Butthere isn't much life left in her .... She put too much into the diary, intome. Enough to let me leave its pages at last .... I have been waiting foryou to appear since we arrived here. I knew you'd come. I have manyquestions for you, Harry Potter.\"\"Like what?\" Harry spat, fists still clenched.\"Well,\" said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, \"how is it that you a skinny boywith no extraordinary magical talent - managed to defeat the greatestwizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, whileLord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?\"There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.\"Why do you care how I escaped?\" said Harry slowly. \"Voldemort wasafter your time ......\"Voldemort,\" said Riddle softly, \"is my past, present, and future, HarryPotter . . . .\"He pulled Harry's wand from his pocket and began to trace itthrough the air, writing three shimmering words:TOM MARVOLO RIDDLEThen he waved the wand once, and the letters of his namerearranged themselves:I AM LORD VOLDEMORT\"You see?\" he whispered. \"It was a name I was already using atHogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think Iwas going to use my filthy Muggle father's name forever? I, in whoseveins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through mymother's side? I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who269abandoned me even before I was born, just because he found out hiswife was a witch? No, Harry - I fashioned myself a new name, aname I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!\"Harry's brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle,at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry's ownparents, and so many others .... At last he forced himself to -,peak.\"You're not,\" he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.\"Not what?\" snapped Riddle.\"Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,\" said Harry, breathing fast.\"Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in theworld is Albus Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when you werestrong, you didn't dare try and take over at Hogwarts. Dumbledoresaw through you when you were at school and he still frightens younow, wherever you're hiding these days -\"The smile had gone from Riddle's face, to be replaced by a very uglylook.*31-4*\"Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory ofme!\" he hissed.\"He's not as gone as you might think!\" Harry retorted. He wasspeaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle, wishing rather thanbelieving it to be trueRiddle opened his mouth, but froze.Music was coming from somewhere. Riddle whirled around to staredown the empty Chamber. The music was growing louder. It waseerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry's scalp andmade his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size.Then, as the music reached such a pitch that Harry felt it vibratinginside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar.A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird music270to the vaulted ceiling. It had a glittering golden tail as long as apeacock's and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a raggedbundle.A second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry. It dropped theragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on hisshoulder. As it folded its great wings, Harry looked up and saw it had along, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye.The bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to Harry's cheek,gazing steadily at Riddle.\"That's a phoenix said Riddle, staring shrewdly back at it.\"Fawkes?\" Harry breathed, and he felt the bird's golden clawssqueeze his shoulder gently\"And that -\" said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes haddropped, \"that's the old school Sorting Hat -\"So it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at Harry'sfeet.Riddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that the darkchamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles were laughing at once\"This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an oldhat! Do you feel brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now?\"Harry didn't answer. He might not see what use Fawkes or theSorting Hat were, but he was no longer alone, and he waited forRiddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting.\"To business, Harry,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly. \"Twice - in yourpast, in my future - we have met. And twice I failed to kill you. Howdid you survive? Tell me everything. The longer you talk,\" he addedsoftly, \"the longer you stay alive.\"Harry was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Riddle had the wand.He, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which wouldbe much good in a duel. It looked bad, all right ... but the longer Riddlestood there, the more life was dwindling out of Ginny ... and in the271meantime, Harry noticed suddenly, Riddle's outline was becomingclearer, more solid .... If it had to be a fight between him and Riddle,better sooner than later.\"No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me,\"said Harry abruptly. \"I don't know myself But I know why youcouldn't kill me. Because my mother died to save me. My commonMuggle-born mother,\" he added, shaking with suppressed rage. \"Shestopped you killing me. And I've seen the real you, I saw you lastyear. You're a wreck. You're barely alive. That's where all yourpower got you. You're in hiding. You're ugly, you're foul -\"*%16*Riddle's face contorted. Then he forced it into an awful smile. \"So.wondered, you see. There are strange likenesses between us, after all.Even you must have noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans, raised byMuggles. Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwartssince the great Slytherin himself We even look something alike ... butafter all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me. That'sall I wanted to know.\"Harry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his wand. But Riddle'stwisted smile was widening again.\"Now, Harry, I'm going to teach you a little lesson. Let's match thepowers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against famousHarry Potter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him . . . .\"He cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then walkedaway. Harry, fear spreading up his numb legs, watched Ridthe stopbetween the high pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin,high above him in the half-darkness. Riddle opened his mouth wide andhissed - but Harry understood what he was saying ....\"Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four. \"Harry wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying on hisshoulder.272Slytherin's gigantic stone face was moving. Horrorstruck, Harry sawhis mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole.And something was stirring inside the statue's mouth. Somethingwas slithering up from its depths. 3 1Harry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall, and as he shuthis eyes tight he felt Fawkes' wing sweep his cheek as he took flight.Harry wanted to shout, \"Don't leave me!\" but what chance did aphoenix have against the king of serpents?Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. Harry felt itshudder - he knew what was happening, he could sense it, couldalmost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin's mouth.Then he heard Riddle's hissing voice:\"Kill him. \"The basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear its heavy bodyslithering heavily across the dusty floor. Eyes still tightly shut, Harrybegan to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way -Voldemort was laughingHarry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpentwas barely feet from him, he could hear it comingThere was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and thensomething heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall.Waiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing,something thrashing wildly off the pillarsHe couldn't help it - he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at whatwas going on.The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk,had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weavingdrunkenly between the pillars. As Harry trembled, ready to close hiseyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake.Fawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snappingfuriously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers273Fawkes dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight and a*318*sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor. The snake's tailthrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and before Harry could shut hiseyes, it turned - Harry looked straight into its face and saw that itseyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by thephoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spittingin agony.HIM. KILL HIMI\"The blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly. Fawkes wascircling its head, piping his eerie song, jabbing here and there at itsscaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes.\"Help me, help me,\" Harry muttered wildly, \"someone - anyoneThe snake's tail whipped across the floor again. Harry ducked.Something soft hit his face.The basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry's arms. Harryseized it. It was all he had left, his only chance - he rammed it onto hishead and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk's tail swungover him again.Help me - help me - Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the hat.Please help meThere was no answering voice. Instead, the hat contracted, as thoughan invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly.Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry's head,almost knocking him out. Stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbedthe top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hardbeneath it.3 19274A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handleglittering with rubies the size of eggs.\"KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU.SNIFF -- SMELL HIM.\"Harry was on his feet, ready. The basilisk's head was falling, its bodycoiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him. He could see thevast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enoughto swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his sword, thin,glittering, venomous -It lunged blindly -- Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall. It lungedagain, and its forked tongue lashed Harry's side. He raised the swordin both his hands -The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true -- Harry threwhis whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roofof the serpent's mouth -But as warm blood drenched Harry's arms, he felt a searing pain justabove his elbow. One long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper anddeeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled oversideways and fell, twitching, to the floor.Harry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that was spreadingpoison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm. But he knew itwas too late. White-hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily fromthe wound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched his own bloodsoaking his robes, his vision went foggy. The Chamber was dissolvingin a whirl of dull color.A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of clawsbeside him.\"Fawkes,\" said Harry thickly. \"You were fantastic, Fawkes . . . .\"1,520He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent'sfang had pierced him.275He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved infront of him.\"You're dead, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle's voice above him. \"Dead.Even Dumbledore's bird knows it. Do you see what he's doing, Potter?He's crying.\"Harry blinked. Fawke's head slid in and out of focus. Thick, pearly tearswere trickling down the glossy feathers.\"I'm going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. Take your time.I'm in no hurry.\"Harry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to be spinning.\"So ends the famous Harry Potter,\" said Riddle's distant voice. \"Alonein the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated at last bythe Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You'll be back with your dearMudblood mother soon, Harry... She bought you twelve years ofborrowed time ... but Lord Voldemort got you in the end, as you knewhe must . . . .\"If this is dying, thought Harry, it's not so bad.Even the pain was leaving him ....But was this dying? Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed to becoming back into focus. Harry gave his head a little shake and there wasFawkes, still resting his head on Harry's arm. A pearly patch of tears wasshining all around the wound -- except that there was no wound\"Get away, bird,\" said Riddle's voice suddenly. \"Get away from him -I said, get away --\"Harry raised his head. Riddle was pointing Harry's wand atFawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in awhirl of gold and scarlet.\"Phoenix tears. - .\" said Riddle quietly, staring at Harry's arm. \"Ofcourse ... healing powers ... I forgot. . .\"276He looked into Harry's face. \"But it makes no difference. In fact, Iprefer it this way. Just you and me, Harry Potter ... you and me....He raised the wandThen, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead andsomething fell into Harry's lap -- the diary.For a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it.Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant todo it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to himand plunged it straight into the heart of the book.There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink spurted out of thediary in torrents, streaming over Harry's hands, flooding the floor.Riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and thenHe had gone. Harry's wand fell to the floor with a clatter and therewas silence. Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozingfrom the diary. The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole rightthrough it.Shaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head was spinning asthough he'd just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, he gatheredtogether his wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrievedthe glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk's mouth.Then came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber. Ginny wasstirring. As Harry hurried toward her, she sat up. Her bemused1,522eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, inhis blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand. She drew a great,shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face.\"Harry -- oh, Harry -- I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I c-couldn'tsay it in front of Percy -- it was me, Harry -- but I -- I s-swear I ddiddtmean to -- R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over -- and - howdid you kill that -- that thing? W-where's Riddle? The last thing I rrememberis him coming out of the diary --\"277\" It's all right,\" said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing Ginny thefang hole, \"Riddle's finished. Look! Him and the basilisk. C'mon,Ginny, let's get out of here --\"\"I'm going to be expelled!\" Ginny wept as Harry helped herawkwardly to her feet. \"I've looked forward to coming to Hogwartsever since B-Bill came and n-now I'll have to leave and -- w-what'llMum and Dad say?\"Fawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance.Harry urged Ginny forward; they stepped over the motionless coils ofthe dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel.Harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss.After a few minutes' progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound ofslowly shifting rock reached Harry's ears.\"Ron!\" Harry yelled, speeding up. \"Ginny's okay! I've got her!\"He heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend tosee his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed tomake in the rock fall.\"Ginny!\" Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull321,3her through first. \"You're alive! I don't believe it! What happened?\"How - what -- where did that bird come from?\"Fawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny.\"He's Dumbledore's,\" said Harry, squeezing through himself\"How come you've got a sword?\" said Ron, gaping at the glitteringweapon in Harry's hand.\"I'll explain when we get out of here,\" said Harry with a sidewaysglance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever.\"But --\"278\"Later,\" Harry said shortly. He didn't think it was a good idea to tellRon yet who'd been opening the Chamber, not in front of Ginny,anyway. \"Where's Lockhart?\"\"Back there,\" said Ron, still looking puzzled but jerking his head up thetunnel toward the pipe. \"He's in a bad way. Come and see.\"Led by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glowin the darkness, they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe.Gilderoy Lockhart was sitting there, humming placidly to himself.\"His memory's gone,\" said Ron. \"The Memory Charm backfired. Hithim instead of us. Hasn't got a clue who he is, or where he is, or whowe are. I told him to come and wait here. He's a danger to himself\"Lockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all.\"Hello,\" he said. \"Odd sort of place, this, isn't it? Do you live here?\"\"No,\" said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry.Harry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe.\"Have you thought how we're going to get back up this?\" he said toRon.*324*Ron shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past Harryand was now fluttering in front of him, his beady eyes bright in thedark. He was waving his long golden tail feathers. Harry lookeduncertainly at him.\"He looks like he wants you to grab hold. . .\" said Ron, lookingperplexed. \"But you're much too heavy for a bird to pull up there -\"\"Fawkes,\" said Harry, \"isn't an ordinary bird.\" He turned quickly to theothers. \"We've got to hold on to each other. Ginny, grab Ron's hand.Professor Lockhart --\"\"He means you,\" said Ron sharply to Lockhart.279\"You hold Ginny's other hand --\"Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, Ron tookhold of the back of Harry's robes, and Harry reached out and tookhold of Fawkes's strangely hot tail feathers.An extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole bodyand the next second, in a rush of wings, they were flying upwardthrough the pipe. Harry could hear Lockhart dangling below him,saying, \"Amazing! Amazing! This is just like magic!\" The chill air waswhipping through Harry's hair, and before he'd stopped enjoying theride, it was over -- all four of them were hitting the wet floor ofMoaning Myrtle's bathroom, and as Lockhart straightened his hat, thesink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place.Myrtle goggled at them.\"You're alive,\" she said blankly to Harry.\"There's no need to sound so disappointed,\" he said grimly, wipingflecks of blood and slime off his glasses.* 325*\"Oh, well ... Id just been thinking ... if you had died, you'd have beenwelcome to share my toilet,\" said Myrtle, blushing silver.\"Urgh!\" said Ron as they left the bathroom for the dark, desertedcorridor outside. \"Harry! I think Myrtle's grown fond of you! You'vegot competition, Ginny!\"But tears were still flooding silently down Ginny's face.\"Where now?\" said Ron, with an anxious look at Ginny. Harry pointed.Fawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor. Theystrode after him, and moments later, found themselves outsideProfessor McGonagall's office.Harry knocked and pushed the door open.G F-I A P T E IR280Y'$ REWARDor a moment there was silence as Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhartstood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime and (in Harry's case)blood. Then there was a scream.\"Ginny!\"It was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in front of the fire.She leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both ofthem flung themselves on their daughter.Harry, however, was looking past them. Professor Dumbledore wasstanding by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor McGonagall,who was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest. Fawkeswent whooshing past Harry's ear and settled on Dumbledore'sshoulder, just as Harry found himself and Ron being swept into Mrs.Weasleys tight embrace.\"You saved her! You saved her! How did you do it?\"\"I think we'd all like to know that,\" said Professor McGonagall weakly.Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a moment, thenwalked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, therubyencrusted sword, and what remained of Riddle's diary.Then he started telling them everything. For nearly a quarter of anhour he spoke into the rapt silence: He told them about hearing thedisembodied voice, how Hermione had finally realized that he washearing a basilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed thespiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them where the lastvictim of the basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning281Myrtle had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber ofSecrets might be in her bathroom ....\"Very well,\" Professor McGonagall prompted him as he paused, \"soyou found out where the entrance was -- breaking a hundred schoolrules into pieces along the way, I might add - but how on earth didyou all get out of there alive, Potter?\"So Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, toldthem about Fawkes's timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat givinghim the sword. But then he faltered. He had so far avoidedmentioning Riddle's diary -- or Ginny. She was standing with herhead against Mrs. Weasley's shoulder, and tears were still coursingsilently down her cheeks. What if they expelled her? Harry thought inpanic. Riddle's diary didn't work anymore .... How could they proveit had been he who'd made her do it all?Instinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who smiled faintly, thefirelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles.\"\\What interests me most,\" said Dumbledore gently, \"is how LordVoldemort managed to enchant Ginny, when my sources tell me he iscurrently in hiding in the forests of Albania.\"*328*Relief -- warm, sweeping, glorious relief -- swept over Harry. \"Wwhat'sthat?\" said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice. \"YouKnow-Who?En-enchant Ginny? But Ginny's not ... Ginny hasn't been ... has she?\"\"It was this diary,\" said Harry quickly, picking it up and showing it toDumbledore. \"Riddle wrote it when he was sixteen . . . .\"Dumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered keenly down hislong, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages.\"Brilliant,\" he said softly. \"Of course, he was probably the mostbrilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.\" He turned around to theWeasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered.\"Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called TomRiddle. I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He282disappeared after leaving the school ... traveled far and wide ... sankso deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of ourkind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, thatwhen he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recognizable.Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever,handsome boy who was once Head Boy here.\"\"But, Ginny,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"What's our Ginny got to do with -with -- him?\"\"His d-diaryl\" Ginny sobbed. \"I've b-been writing in it, and he's beenw-writing back all year --\"\"tinny!\" said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. \"Haven't I taught youanything. What have I always told you? Never trust anything that canthink for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain? Why didn'tyou show the diary to me, or your mother? A suspicious object likethat, it was clearly full of Dark Magic ='*329*\"I d-didn't know,\" sobbed Ginny. \"I found it inside one of the booksMum got me. I th-thought someone had just left it in there andforgotten about it --\"\"Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away,\"Dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice. \"This has been a terribleordeal for her. There will be no punishment. Older and wiser wizardsthan she have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort.\" He strode overto the door and opened it. \"Bed rest and perhaps a large, steamingmug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up,\" he added,twinkling kindly down at her. \"You will find that Madam Pomfrey isstill awake. She's just giving out Mandrake juice -- I daresay thebasilisk's victims will be waking up any moment.\"\"So Hermione's okay!\" said Ron brightly.\"There has been no lasting harm done, Ginny,\" said Dumbledore.Mrs. Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr. Weasley followed, still lookingdeeply shaken.283\"You know, Minerva,\" Professor Dumbledore said thoughtfully toProfessor McGonagall, \"I think all this merits a good feast. Might I askyou to go and alert the kitchens?\"\"Right,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply, also moving to the door.\"I'll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I?\"\"Certainly,\" said Dumbledore.She left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore. Whatexactly had Professor McGonagall meant, deal with them? Surely -surely - they weren't about to be punished?\"I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you ifyou broke any more school rules, said Dumbledore.*%30*Ron opened his mouth in horror.\"Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat ourwords,\" Dumbledore went on, smiling. \"You will both receive SpecialAwards for Services to the School and -- let me see - yes, I think twohundred points apiece for Gryffindor.\"Ron went as briglitly pink as Lockhart's valentine flowers and closedhis mouth again.\"But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in thisdangerous adventure,\" Dumbledore added. \"Why so modest,Gilderoy?\"Harry gave a start. He had completely forgotten about Lockhart. Heturned and saw that Lockhart was standing in a corner of the room,still wearing his vague smile. When Dumbledore addressed him,Lockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to.\"Professor Dumbledore,\" Ron said quickly, \"there was an accidentdown in the Chamber of Secrets. Professor Lockhart --\"\"Am I a professor?\" said Lockhart in mild surprise. \"Goodness. Iexpect I was hopeless, was I?\"284\"He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired,\" Ronexplained quietly to Dumbledore.\"Dear me,\" said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his long silvermustache quivering. \"Impaled upon your own sword, Gilderoy!\"\"Sword?\" said Lockhart dimly. \"Haven't got a sword. That boy has,though.\" He pointed at Harry. \"He'll lend you one.\"\"Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the infirmary, too?\"Dumbledore said to Ron. \"Id like a few more words with Harry .....Lockhart ambled out. Ron cast a curious look back at Dumbledore andHarry as he closed the door.Dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire.\"Sit down, Harry,\" he said, and Harry sat, feeling unaccountablynervous.\"First of all, Harry, I want to thank you,\" said Dumbledore, eyestwinkling again. \"You must have shown me real loyalty down in theChamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.\"He stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto his knee.Harry grinned awkwardly as Dumbledore watched him.\"And so you met Tom Riddle,\" said Dumbledore thoughtfully. \"Iimagine he was most interested in you . . . . \"Suddenly, something that was nagging at Harry came tumbling out ofhis mouth.\"Professor Dumbledore ... Riddle said I'm like him. Strange likenesses,he said ......\"Did he, now?\" said Dumbledore, looking thoughtfully at Harry fromunder his thick silver eyebrows. \"And what do you think, Harry?\"\"I don't think I'm like him!\" said Harry, more loudly than he'd intended.\"I mean, I'm -- I'm in Gryffindor, I'm . . .\"285But he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind.\"Professor,\" he started again after a moment. \"The Sorting Hat told meId -- Id have done well in Slytherin. Everyone thought I was Slytherin'sheir for a while ... because I can speak Parseltongue ....\"You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,\" said Dumbledore calmly,\"because Lord Voldemort -- who is the last remaining ancestor*$32*of Salazar Slytherin -- can speak Parseltongue. Unless I'm muchmistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to you the night hegave you that scar. Not something he intended to do, I'm sure ....\"Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?\" Harry said, thunderstruck.\"It certainly seems so.\"\"So I should be in Slytherin,\" Harry said, looking desperately intoDumbledore's face. \"The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin's power inme, and it --\"\"Put you in Gryffindor,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Listen to me, Harry.You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his handpickedstudents. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue -resourcefulness - determination -- a certain disregard for rules,\" headded, his mustache quivering again. \"Yet the Sorting Hat placed youin Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.\"\"It only put me in Gryffindor,\" said Harry in a defeated voice, \"becauseI asked not to go in Slytherin . . . .\"`Exactly, \"said Dumbledore, beaming once more. \"Which makes youvery different from Tom Riddle. It is our choices, Harry, that show whatwe truly are, far more than our abilities.\" Harry sat motionless in hischair, stunned. \"If you want proof, Harry, that you belong inGryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this.\"Dumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall's desk, pickedup the blood-stained silver sword, and handed it to Harry. Dully, Harry286turned it over, the rubies blazing in the firelight. And then he saw thename engraved just below the hilt.Godric Gryffindor*333*\"Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, Harry,\"said Dumbledore simply.For a minute, neither of them spoke. Then Dumbledore pulled openone of the drawers in Professor McGonagall's desk and took out a quilland a bottle of ink.What you need, Harry, is some food and sleep. I suggest you go downto the feast, while I write to Azkaban -- we need our gamekeeperback. And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet, too,\" headded thoughtfully. \"We'll be needing a new Defense Against theDark Arts teacher... Dear me, we do seem to run through them, don'twe?\"Harry got up and crossed to the door. He had just reached for thehandle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it bouncedback off the wall.Lucius Malfoy stood there, fury in his face. And cowering behind hislegs, heavily wrapped in bandages, was Dobby.\"Good evening, Lucius,\" said Dumbledore pleasantly.Mr. Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as he swept into the room.Dobby went scurrying in after him, crouching at the hem of his cloak,a look of abject terror on his face.The elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting tofinish cleaning Mr. Malfoys shoes. Apparently Mr. Malfoy had set outin a great hurry, for not only were his shoes half-polished, but hisusually sleek hair was disheveled. Ignoring the elf bobbingapologetically around his ankles, he fixed his cold eyes uponDumbledore.\"So!\" he said \"You've come back. The governors suspended you, but287you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts.\"*%$4*\"Well, you see, Lucius,\" said Dumbledore, smiling serenely, \"theother eleven governors contacted me today. It was something likebeing caught in a hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. They'd heard thatArthur Weasleys daughter had been killed and wanted me back hereat once. They seemed to think I was the best man for the job afterall. Very strange tales they told me, too .... Several of them seemedto think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didn'tagree to suspend me in the first place.\"Mr. Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes were still slits offury.\"So -- have you stopped the attacks yet?\" he sneered. \"Have youcaught the culprit?\"\"We have,\" said Dumbledore, with a smile.\"Well?\"said Mr. Malfoy sharply. \"Who is it?\"\"The same person as last time, Lucius,\" said Dumbledore. \"But thistime, Lord Voldemort was acting through somebody else. By meansof this diary.\"He held up the small black book with the large hole through thecenter, watching Mr. Malfoy closely. Harry, however, was watchingDobby.The elf was doing something very odd. His great eyes fixedmeaningfully on Harry, he kept pointing at the diary, then at Mr.Malfoy, and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist.\"I see. . . \" said Mr. Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore.\"A clever plan,\" said Dumbledore in a level voice, still staring Mr.Malfoy straight in the eye. \"Because if Harry here\" --Mr. Malfoy shotHarry a swift, sharp look -- \"and his friend Ron hadn't discoveredthis book, why -- Ginny Weasley might have taken all288*335*the blame. No one would ever have been able to prove she hadn'tacted of her own free will ......Mr. Malfoy said nothing. His face was suddenly masklike.\"And imagine,\" Dumbledore went on, \"what might have happenedthen .... The Weasleys are one of our most prominent pure-bloodfamilies. Imagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his MuggleProtection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and -killing Muggle-borns .... Very fortunate the diary was discovered,and Riddle's memories wiped from it. \"Who knows what theconsequences might have been otherwise ......Mr. Malfoy forced himself to speak.\"Very fortunate,\" he said stiffly.And still, behind his back, Dobby was pointing, first to the diary,then to Lucius Malfoy, then punching himself in the head.And Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at Dobby, and Dobbybacked into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment.\"Don't you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary, Mr.Malfoy?\" said Harry.Lucius Malfoy rounded on him.\"How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?\" he said.\"Because you gave it to her,\" said Harry. \"In Flourish and Blotts.You picked up her old Transfiguration book and slipped the diaryinside it, didn't you?\"He saw Mr. Malfoy's white hands clench and unclench.\"Prove it,\" he hissed.\"Oh, no one will be able to do that,\" said Dumbledore, smiling atHarry. \"Not now that Riddle has vanished from the book. On289*336*the other hand, I would advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out anymore of Lord Voldemort's old school things. If any more of them findtheir way into innocent hands, I think Arthur Weasley, for one, willmake sure they are traced back to you ......Lucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Harry distinctly saw his righthand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand. Instead,he turned to his house-elf\"We're going, Dobby!\"He wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him,he kicked him right through it. They could hear Dobby squealing withpain all the way along the corridor. Harry stood for a moment,thinking hard. Then it came to him -\"Professor Dumbledore,\" he said hurriedly. \"Can I give that diaryback to Mr. Malfoy, please?\"\"Certainly, Harry,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"But hurry. The feast,remember ......Harry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office. He could hearDobby's squeals of pain receding around the corner. Quickly,wondering if this plan could possibly work, Harry took off one of hisshoes, pulled off his slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary into it.Then he ran down the dark corridor.He caught up with them at the top of the stairs.\"Mr. Malfoy,\" he gasped, skidding to a halt, \"I've got something foryou --\"And he forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy's hand.\")What the --?\"Mr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then lookedfuriously from the ruined book to Harry.290*',531*You'll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days,Harry Potter,\" he said softly. \"They were meddlesome fools, too.He turned to go.\"Come, Dobby. I said, come.\"But Dobby didn't move. He was holding up Harry's disgusting, slimysock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure.\"Master has given a sock,\" said the elf in wonderment. \"Master gaveit to Dobby.\"\"What's that?\" spat Mr. Malfoy. \"What did you say?\"\"Got a sock,\" said Dobby in disbelief. \"Master threw it, and Dobbycaught it, and Dobby -- Dobby is free. \"Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf Then he lunged atHarry.\"You've lost me my servant, boy!\"But Dobby shouted, \"You shall not harm Harry Potter!\"There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. Hecrashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heapon the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out hiswand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger.\"You shall go now,\" he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy.\"You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.\"Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pairof them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.\"Harry Potter freed Dobby!\" said the elf shrilly, gazing up at Harry,moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes.\"Harry Potter set Dobby free!\"291\"Least I could do, Dobby,\" said Harry, grinning. \"Just promise neverto try and save my life again.\"The elf's ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile.\"I've just got one question, Dobby,\" said Harry as Dobby pulled onHarry's sock with shaking hands. \"You told me all this had nothing todo with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well --\"\"It was a clue, sir,\" said Dobby, his eyes widening, as though this wasobvious. \"Was giving you a clue. The Dark Lord, before he changedhis name, could be freely named, you see?\"\"Right,\" said Harry weakly. \"Well, Id better go. There's a feast, andmy friend Hermione should be awake by now .....Dobby threw his arms around Harry's middle and hugged him.\"Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!\" he sobbed.\"Farewell, Harry Potter!\"And with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared.Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite likethis. Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted allnight. Harry didn't know whether the best bit was Hermione runningtoward him, screaming \"You solved it! You solved it!\" or Justinhurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring. his hand andapologize endlessly for suspecting him, or Hagrid turning up at halfpast three, cuffing Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that theywere knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and Ron's four hundredpoints for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second yearrunning, or Professor McGonagall standing up to*339*tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat (\"Oh,no!\" said Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that, unfortunately,Professor Lockhart would be unable to return next year, owing to thefact that he needed to go away and get his memory back. Quite a fewof the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news.292\"Shame,\" said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut. \"He wasstarting to grow on me.\"The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine.Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences -Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled (\"but we'vehad plenty of practice at that anyway,\" Ron told a disgruntledHermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a school governor.Draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he ownedthe place. On the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky. On the otherhand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again.Too soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express.Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a compartment tothemselves. They made the most of the last few hours in which theywere allowed to do magic before the holidays. They played ExplodingSnap, set off the very last of Fred and George's Filibuster fireworks,and practiced disarming each other by magic. Harry was getting verygood at it.They were almost at King's Cross when Harry rememberedsomething.\"Ginny - what did you see Percy doing, that he didn't want you to tellanyone?\"*340*\"Oh, that,\" said Ginny, giggling. \"Well - Percy's got a girlfriend.\" Freddropped a stack of books on George's head.\"What?\"\"It's that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Clearwater,\" said Ginny.\"That's who he was writing to all last summer. He's been meeting herall over the school in secret. I walked in on them kissing in an emptyclassroom one day. He was so upset when she was -- you know -attacked. You won't tease him, will you?\" she added anxiously.\"Wouldn't dream of it,\" said Fred, who was looking like his birthdayhad come early.293\"Definitely not,\" said George, sniggering.The Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped.Harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to Ronand Hermione.\"This is called a telephone number,\" he told Ron, scribbling it twice,tearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them. \"I told your dadhow to use a telephone last summer - he'll know. Call me at theDursleys', okay? I can't stand another two months with only Dudleyto talk to ......\"Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won't they?\" saidHermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd throngingtoward the enchanted barrier. \"When they hear what you did thisyear?\"\"Proud?\" said Harry. \"Are you crazy? All those times I could'vedied, and I didn't manage it? They'll be furious ......And together they walked back through the gateway to the Muggleworld. '*341*"
